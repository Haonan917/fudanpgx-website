    "abstract": "Characterization and integration of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of different datasets is difficult owing to a lack of ground truth. Here we develop and characterize suites of publicly available multi-omics reference materials of matched DNA, RNA, protein and metabolites derived from immortalized cell lines from a family quartet of parents and monozygotic twin daughters. These references provide built-in truth defined by relationships among the family members and the information flow from DNA to RNA to protein. We demonstrate how using a ratio-based profiling approach that scales the absolute feature values of a study sample relative to those of a concurrently measured common reference sample produces reproducible and comparable data suitable for integration across batches, labs, platforms and omics types. Our study identifies reference-free ‘absolute’ feature quantification as the root cause of irreproducibility in multi-omics measurement and data integration and establishes the advantages of ratio-based multi-omics profiling with common reference materials. © The Author(s) 2023.",

    "abstract": "Certified RNA reference materials are indispensable for assessing the reliability of RNA sequencing to detect intrinsically small biological differences in clinical settings, such as molecular subtyping of diseases. As part of the Quartet Project for quality control and data integration of multi-omics profiling, we established four RNA reference materials derived from immortalized B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from four members of a monozygotic twin family. Additionally, we constructed ratio-based transcriptome-wide reference datasets between two samples, providing cross-platform and cross-laboratory ‘ground truth’. Investigation of the intrinsically subtle biological differences among the Quartet samples enables sensitive assessment of cross-batch integration of transcriptomic measurements at the ratio level. The Quartet RNA reference materials, combined with the ratio-based reference datasets, can serve as unique resources for assessing and improving the quality of transcriptomic data in clinical and biological settings. © The Author(s) 2023. corrected publication 2023.",

We previously performed a large single-center and multiomics study consisting of genomics, transcriptomics, and clinical information from 465 patients with primary TNBC. To facilitate reusing this unique dataset, we provided a detailed description of the dataset with special attention to data quality in this study. The multiomics data were generally of high quality, but a few sequencing data had quality issues and should be noted in subsequent data reuse. Furthermore, we reconduct data analyses with updated pipelines and the updated version of the human reference genome from hg19 to hg38. The updated profiles were in good concordance with those previously published in terms of gene quantification, variant calling, and copy number alteration. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly web-based database for convenient access and interactive exploration of the dataset. Our work will facilitate reusing the dataset, maximize the values of data and further accelerate cancer research. © 2022, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing is being rapidly adopted in precision oncology, but the accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility of ctDNA assays is poorly understood. Here we report the findings of a multi-site, cross-platform evaluation of the analytical performance of five industry-leading ctDNA assays. We evaluated each stage of the ctDNA sequencing workflow with simulations, synthetic DNA spike-in experiments and proficiency testing on standardized, cell-line-derived reference samples. Above 0.5% variant allele frequency, ctDNA mutations were detected with high sensitivity, precision and reproducibility by all five assays, whereas, below this limit, detection became unreliable and varied widely between assays, especially when input material was limited. Missed mutations (false negatives) were more common than erroneous candidates (false positives), indicating that the reliable sampling of rare ctDNA fragments is the key challenge for ctDNA assays. This comprehensive evaluation of the analytical performance of ctDNA assays serves to inform best practice guidelines and provides a resource for precision oncology. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",

    "abstract": "Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) are a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). To incorporate sTILs into clinical trials and diagnostics, reliable assessment is essential. In this review, we propose a new concept, namely the implementation of a risk-management framework that enables the use of sTILs as a stratification factor in clinical trials. We present the design of a biomarker risk-mitigation workflow that can be applied to any biomarker incorporation in clinical trials. We demonstrate the implementation of this concept using sTILs as an integral biomarker in a single-center phase II immunotherapy trial for metastatic TNBC (TONIC trial, NCT02499367), using this workflow to mitigate risks of suboptimal inclusion of sTILs in this specific trial. In this review, we demonstrate that a web-based scoring platform can mitigate potential risk factors when including sTILs in clinical trials, and we argue that this framework can be applied for any future biomarker-driven clinical trial setting. © 2020, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "In contrast to protein-coding genes, long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are much less well understood, despite increasing evidence indicating a wide range of their biological functions, and possible roles in various cancers. Based on public RNA-seq datasets of four solid cancer types, we here utilize Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) to propose a strategy for exploring the functions of lncRNAs altered in more than two cancer types, which we call onco-lncRNAs. Results indicate that cancer-expressed lncRNAs show high tissue specificity and are weakly expressed, more so than protein-coding genes. Most of the 236 onco-lncRNAs we identified have not been reported to have associations with cancers before. Our analysis exploits co-expression network to reveal that onco-lncRNAs likely play key roles in the multistep development of human cancers, covering a wide range of functions in genome stability maintenance, signaling, cell adhesion and motility, morphogenesis, cell cycle, immune and inflammatory response. These observations contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of cancer-associated lncRNAs, while demonstrating a novel and efficient strategy for subsequent functional studies of lncRNAs. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common types in the world with a high mortality rate. Despite advances in treatment strategies, the overall survival (OS) remains short. Our study aims to establish a reliable prognostic signature closely related to the survival of LUAD patients that can better predict prognosis and possibly help with individual monitoring of LUAD patients. Methods: Raw RNA-sequencing data were obtained from Fudan University and used as a training group. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for the training group were screened. The univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate cox regression analysis were conducted to identify the candidate prognostic genes and construct the risk score model. Kaplan–Meier analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the prognostic power and performance of the signature. Moreover, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-LUAD) dataset was further used to validate the predictive ability of prognostic signature. Results: A prognostic signature consisting of seven prognostic-related genes was constructed using the training group. The 7-gene prognostic signature significantly grouped patients in high and low-risk groups in terms of overall survival in the training cohort [hazard ratio, HR = 8.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)] [2.041–39.2]; P = 0.0004), and in the validation cohort (HR = 2.41, 95% CI [1.779–3.276]; P < 0.0001). Cox regression analysis (univariate and multivariate) demonstrated that the seven-gene signature is an independent prognostic biomarker for predicting the survival of LUAD patients. ROC curves revealed that the 7-gene prognostic signature achieved a good performance in training and validation groups (AUC = 0.91, AUC = 0.7 respectively) in predicting OS for LUAD patients. Furthermore, the stratified analysis of the signature showed another classification to predict the prognosis. Conclusion: Our study suggested a new and reliable prognostic signature that has a significant implication in predicting overall survival for LUAD patients and may help with early diagnosis and making effective clinical decisions regarding potential individual treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is increasingly recognized as an integral part of the prognostic workflow in triple-negative (TNBC) and HER2-positive breast cancer, as well as many other solid tumors. This recognition has come about thanks to standardized visual reporting guidelines, which helped to reduce inter-reader variability. Now, there are ripe opportunities to employ computational methods that extract spatio-morphologic predictive features, enabling computer-aided diagnostics. We detail the benefits of computational TILs assessment, the readiness of TILs scoring for computational assessment, and outline considerations for overcoming key barriers to clinical translation in this arena. Specifically, we discuss: 1. ensuring computational workflows closely capture visual guidelines and standards; 2. challenges and thoughts standards for assessment of algorithms including training, preanalytical, analytical, and clinical validation; 3. perspectives on how to realize the potential of machine learning models and to overcome the perceptual and practical limits of visual scoring. © 2020, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Background: Reproducible detection of inherited variants with whole genome sequencing (WGS) is vital for the implementation of precision medicine and is a complicated process in which each step affects variant call quality. Systematically assessing reproducibility of inherited variants with WGS and impact of each step in the process is needed for understanding and improving quality of inherited variants from WGS. Results: To dissect the impact of factors involved in detection of inherited variants with WGS, we sequence triplicates of eight DNA samples representing two populations on three short-read sequencing platforms using three library kits in six labs and call variants with 56 combinations of aligners and callers. We find that bioinformatics pipelines (callers and aligners) have a larger impact on variant reproducibility than WGS platform or library preparation. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), particularly outside difficult-to-map regions, are more reproducible than small insertions and deletions (indels), which are least reproducible when > 5 bp. Increasing sequencing coverage improves indel reproducibility but has limited impact on SNVs above 30×. Conclusions: Our findings highlight sources of variability in variant detection and the need for improvement of bioinformatics pipelines in the era of precision medicine with WGS. © 2021, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Background: Copy number variation (CNV) is a key genetic characteristic for cancer diagnostics and can be used as a biomarker for the selection of therapeutic treatments. Using data sets established in our previous study, we benchmark the performance of cancer CNV calling by six most recent and commonly used software tools on their detection accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility. In comparison to other orthogonal methods, such as microarray and Bionano, we also explore the consistency of CNV calling across different technologies on a challenging genome. Results: While consistent results are observed for copy gain, loss, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) calls across sequencing centers, CNV callers, and different technologies, variation of CNV calls are mostly affected by the determination of genome ploidy. Using consensus results from six CNV callers and confirmation from three orthogonal methods, we establish a high confident CNV call set for the reference cancer cell line (HCC1395). Conclusions: NGS technologies and current bioinformatics tools can offer reliable results for detection of copy gain, loss, and LOH. However, when working with a hyper-diploid genome, some software tools can call excessive copy gain or loss due to inaccurate assessment of genome ploidy. With performance matrices on various experimental conditions, this study raises awareness within the cancer research community for the selection of sequencing platforms, sample preparation, sequencing coverage, and the choice of CNV detection tools. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.",

However, the heterogeneous form of data and uneven distribution of targets make drug discovery and precision medicine a non-trivial task. This study takes pyroptosis therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a paradigm and uses data mining of a large TNBC cohort and drug databases to establish a biofactor-regulated neural network for rapidly screening and optimizing compound pyroptosis drug pairs. Subsequently, biomimetic nanococrystals are prepared using the preferred combination of mitoxantrone and gambogic acid for rational drug delivery. The unique mechanism of obtained nanococrystals regulating pyroptosis genes through ribosomal stress and triggering pyroptosis cascade immune effects are revealed in TNBC models.

Methods: Whole-exome sequencing and phenotypic characterisation were performed, and patients were followed up for a median of 44 months. Results: We analyzed the association of the TTN variants with the clinical outcomes in a prospective study of 1,041 patients with sporadic DCM. TTN truncating variants (tTTN) were detected in 120 (11.5%) patients as compared with 2.4/10,000 East Asian populations in the Genome Aggregation Database (GnomAD; p < 0.0001). Pathogenic TTN missense variants were also enriched in DCM as compared with the GnomAD populations (27.6 vs. 5.9%, p < 0.0001). DCM patients with tTTN had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (28.89 ± 8.72 vs. 31.81 ± 9.97, p = 0.002) and a lower frequency of the left bundle branch block (3.3 vs. 11.3%, p = 0.011) than those without or with mutations in other known causal genes (OCG). However, tTTN were not associated with the composite primary endpoint of cardiac death and heart transplantation during the follow-up period [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.912; 95% confidence interval: 0.464–1.793; p = 0.790]. There was also no sex-dependent effect. Concomitant tTTN and pathogenic variants in OCG were present in only eight DCM patients and did not affect the outcome. Conclusion: The phenotype of DCM caused by tTTN, major causes of sporadic DCM, is not distinctly different from those caused by other causal genes for DCM.

    "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely used in a variety of biomedical applications. Previous studies demonstrated that AgNPs significantly enhanced bone cell mineralization and differentiation in MC3T3–1 cells, a model in vitro system, when compared to several other NPs. This increased bone deposition was evaluated by phenotypic measurements and assessment of the expression of miRNAs associated with regulation of bone morphogenic proteins. In the present study, we used RNA-seq technology, a more direct measurement of gene expression, to investigate further the mechanisms of bone differentiation induced by AgNP treatment. Key factors associated with the osteoclast pathway were significantly increased in response to AgNP exposure including Bmp4, Bmp6 and Fosl1. In addition, genes of metabolism and toxicity pathways were significantly regulated as well. Although this study suggests the potential for AgNPs to influence bone morphogenesis in injury or disease applications, further investigation into the efficacy and safety of AgNPs in bone regeneration is warranted.

However, there is a lack of convenient tools that balance reproducibility with ease of use. To address this problem, we develop BioVisReport, a lightweight solution for the rapid generation of an interactive website based on a user-defined Markdown file, which acts as a text markup language without requiring users to master complex syntax and allows them to preview the results in real-time. Interactive websites generated by the tool can help readers conveniently reproduce research findings and perform further in-depth analyses beyond those reported in the original peer-reviewed publications. Currently, BioVisReport offers 17 basic types of plots for visualizing published data. In addition, the extensibility of BioVisReport supports flexible integration of user-developed Python plugins with multiple programming languages.

    "abstract": "The use of various omics techniques for scientific research is increasing. While toxicogenomics studies have already produced substantial data on diverse omics platforms, to date there has been little routine application in regulatory toxicology. This is despite the promises and excitement of 20 years ago when it was widely speculated that omics methods would reduce or even replace animal use and allow a much enhanced understanding of hazard and susceptibility. One of the reasons for this has been a trepidation about relying on the produced data. It has been argued that omics outputs might not be sufficiently reliable for regulatory application because the techniques, bioinformatics and interpretation can vary. For these reasons the robustness of the obtained results is questioned. This reticence to trust omics data is further magnified by the lack of internationally agreed upon guidelines and protocols for both the generation and processing of omics data. One way forward would be to reach a consensus on an omics data analysis framework (ODAF) for regulatory application (R-ODAF) based on rigorous data analysis. The authors of this article are involved in a Long-Range Research Initiative (LRI) project that will propose an R-ODAF for transcriptomics data. The R-ODAF will then be reviewed and evaluated by the main regulatory agencies and consensus forums such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This work builds on The MicroArray Quality Control work that developed standards for the generation of data from microarrays and sequencing but not for reporting or analysis. © 2020",

Putative therapeutic targets or biomarkers were identified among each subtype. Importantly, the LAR subtype showed more ERBB2 somatic mutations, infrequent mutational signature 3 and frequent CDKN2A loss.

We present a new analysis using these expanded data, where we address the most significant suggestions for improvements on our published analysis - that targeted therapies and broad cytotoxic drugs should have been treated differently in assessing consistency, that consistency of both molecular profiles and drug sensitivity measurements should be compared across cell lines, and that the software analysis tools provided should have been easier to run, particularly as the GDSC and CCLE released additional data. Our re-analysis supports our previous finding that gene expression data are significantly more consistent than drug sensitivity measurements. Using new statistics to assess data consistency allowed identification of two broad effect drugs and three targeted drugs with moderate to good consistency in drug sensitivity data between GDSC and CCLE. For three other targeted drugs, there were not enough sensitive cell lines to assess the consistency of the pharmacological profiles. We found evidence of inconsistencies in pharmacological phenotypes for the remaining eight drugs. Overall, our findings suggest that the drug sensitivity data in GDSC and CCLE continue to present challenges for robust biomarker discovery. This re-analysis provides additional support for the argument that experimental standardization and validation of pharmacogenomic response will be necessary to advance the broad use of large pharmacogenomic screens. © 2017 Safikhani Z et al.",

    "abstract": "We identified a rare missense germline mutation in BARD1 (c.403G>A or p.Asp135Asn) as pathogenic using integrated genomics and transcriptomics profiling of germline and tumor samples from an early-onset triple-negative breast cancer patient who later was administrated with a PARP inhibitor for 2 months. We demonstrated in cell and mouse models that, compared to the wild-type, (1) c.403G>A mutant cell lines were more sensitive to irradiation, a DNA damage agent, and a PARP inhibitor; (2) c.403G>A mutation inhibited interaction between BARD1 and RAD51 (but not BRCA1); and (3) c.403G>A mutant mice were hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. Our study shed lights on the clinical interpretation of rare germline mutations of BARD1. © 2021, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) are important prognostic and predictive biomarkers in triple-negative (TNBC) and HER2-positive breast cancer. Incorporating sTILs into clinical practice necessitates reproducible assessment. Previously developed standardized scoring guidelines have been widely embraced by the clinical and research communities. We evaluated sources of variability in sTIL assessment by pathologists in three previous sTIL ring studies. We identify common challenges and evaluate impact of discrepancies on outcome estimates in early TNBC using a newly-developed prognostic tool. Discordant sTIL assessment is driven by heterogeneity in lymphocyte distribution. Additional factors include: technical slide-related issues; scoring outside the tumor boundary; tumors with minimal assessable stroma; including lymphocytes associated with other structures; and including other inflammatory cells. Small variations in sTIL assessment modestly alter risk estimation in early TNBC but have the potential to affect treatment selection if cutpoints are employed. Scoring and averaging multiple areas, as well as use of reference images, improve consistency of sTIL evaluation. Moreover, to assist in avoiding the pitfalls identified in this analysis, we developed an educational resource available at www.tilsinbreastcancer.org/pitfalls. © 2020, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "RNA secondary structure may influence many cellular processes, including RNA processing, stability, localization, and translation. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) that alter RNA secondary structure, referred to as riboSNitches, are potentially causative of human diseases, especially in untranslated regions (UTRs) and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The functions of somatic mutations that act as riboSNitches in cancer development remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed a computational pipeline called SNIPER (riboSNitch-enriched or depleted elements in cancer genomes), which employs MeanDiff and EucDiff to detect riboSNitches and then identifies riboSNitch-enriched or riboSNitch-depleted non-coding elements across tumors. SNIPER is available at github: https://github.com/suzhixi/SNIPER/. We found that riboSNitches were more likely to be pathogenic. Moreover, we predicted several UTRs and lncRNAs (long non-coding RNA) that significantly enriched or depleted riboSNitches in cancer genomes, indicative of potential cancer driver or essential noncoding elements. Our study highlights the possibly neglected importance of RNA secondary structure in cancer genomes and provides a new strategy to identify new cancer-associated genes. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "The majority of patients with neuroblastoma due to MYCN oncogene amplification and consequent N-Myc oncoprotein over-expression die of the disease. Here our analyses of RNA sequencing data identify the long noncoding RNA lncNB1 as one of the transcripts most over-expressed in MYCN-amplified, compared with MYCN-non-amplified, human neuroblastoma cells and also the most over-expressed in neuroblastoma compared with all other cancers. lncNB1 binds to the ribosomal protein RPL35 to enhance E2F1 protein synthesis, leading to DEPDC1B gene transcription. The GTPase-activating protein DEPDC1B induces ERK protein phosphorylation and N-Myc protein stabilization. Importantly, lncNB1 knockdown abolishes neuroblastoma cell clonogenic capacity in vitro and leads to neuroblastoma tumor regression in mice, while high levels of lncNB1 and RPL35 in human neuroblastoma tissues predict poor patient prognosis. This study therefore identifies lncNB1 and its binding protein RPL35 as key factors for promoting E2F1 protein synthesis, N-Myc protein stability and N-Myc-driven oncogenesis, and as therapeutic targets. © 2019, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Murine transplantation models are used extensively to research immunological rejection and tolerance. Here we studied both murine heart and liver allograft models using microarray technology. We had difficulty in identifying genes related to acute rejections expressed in both heart and liver transplantation models using two standard methodologies: Student's t test and linear models for microarray data (Limma). Here we describe a new method, standardized fold change (SFC), for differential analysis of microarray data. We estimated the performance of SFC, the t test and Limma by generating simulated microarray data 100 times. SFC performed better than the t test and showed a higher sensitivity than Limma where there is a larger value for fold change of expression. SFC gave better reproducibility than Limma and the t test with real experimental data from the MicroArray Quality Control platform and expression data from a mouse cardiac allograft. Eventually, a group of significant overlapping genes was detected by SFC in the expression data of mouse cardiac and hepatic allografts and further validated with the quantitative RT-PCR assay. The group included genes for important reactions of transplantation rejection and revealed functional changes of the immune system in both heart and liver of the mouse model. We suggest that SFC can be utilized to stably and effectively detect differential gene expression and to explore microarray data in further studies. © 2017 The Authors.

    "abstract": "High-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) is a shotgun approach applied in a parallel fashion by which the genome is fragmented and sequenced through small pieces and then analyzed either by aligning to a known reference genome or by de novo assembly without reference genome. This technology has led researchers to conduct an explosion of sequencing related projects in multidisciplinary fields of science. However, due to the limitations of sequencing-based chemistry, length of sequencing reads and the complexity of genes, it is difficult to determine the sequences of some portions of the human genome, leaving gaps in genomic data that frustrate further analysis. Particularly, some complex genes are difficult to be accurately sequenced or mapped because they contain high GC-content and/or low complexity regions, and complicated pseudogenes, such as the genes encoding xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and transporters (XMETs). The genetic variants in XMET genes are critical to predicate inter-individual variability in drug efficacy, drug safety and susceptibility to environmental toxicity. We summarized and discussed challenges, wet-lab methods, and bioinformatics algorithms in sequencing “complex” XMET genes, which may provide insightful information in the application of NGS technology for implementation in toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomics. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

    "abstract": "Background: Oncopanel genomic testing, which identifies important somatic variants, is increasingly common in medical practice and especially in clinical trials. Currently, there is a paucity of reliable genomic reference samples having a suitably large number of pre-identified variants for properly assessing oncopanel assay analytical quality and performance. The FDA-led Sequencing and Quality Control Phase 2 (SEQC2) consortium analyze ten diverse cancer cell lines individually and their pool, termed Sample A, to develop a reference sample with suitably large numbers of coding positions with known (variant) positives and negatives for properly evaluating oncopanel analytical performance. Results: In reference Sample A, we identify more than 40,000 variants down to 1% allele frequency with more than 25,000 variants having less than 20% allele frequency with 1653 variants in COSMIC-related genes. This is 5–100× more than existing commercially available samples. We also identify an unprecedented number of negative positions in coding regions, allowing statistical rigor in assessing limit-of-detection, sensitivity, and precision. Over 300 loci are randomly selected and independently verified via droplet digital PCR with 100% concordance. Agilent normal reference Sample B can be admixed with Sample A to create new samples with a similar number of known variants at much lower allele frequency than what exists in Sample A natively, including known variants having allele frequency of 0.02%, a range suitable for assessing liquid biopsy panels. Conclusion: These new reference samples and their admixtures provide superior capability for performing oncopanel quality control, analytical accuracy, and validation for small to large oncopanels and liquid biopsy assays. © 2021, The Author(s).",

Methods: Based on the NEXTFLEX® small RNA-seq kit and Sciclone® NGSx workstation of PerkinElmer, we established an automated miRNA library construction method. To mimic the clinical samples, three types of reference plasma samples were collected separately from a healthy male, a healthy female and patients with type 2 diabetes. Four batches of miRNA libraries of the reference plasmas were constructed with the automated method. We evaluated the cross-batch concordance from the aspects of miRNA detection, absolute quantification, relative quantification and differentially expressed miRNAs between different samples. Results: The concordance of miRNA detection: the average Jaccard indexes of intra-batch and inter-batch comparisons were 0.61 and 0.62, respectively;the concordance of miRNA absolute quantification:the average Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.96 for both intra-batch and inter-batch comparisons; the concordance of relative quantification:the inter-batch correlation coefficients were 0.74 on average. More than 60% of differentially expressed miRNAs were detected reproducibly across batches. Conclusion: We established a high-througput and automated plasma miRNA library construction method with high inter-batch and cross-batch concordance, making it suitable for miRNA profiling of plasma samples from large cohort studies. © 2022, Editorial Department of Fudan University Journal of Medical Sciences.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents a diverse set of myocardial diseases characterized by notable genetic heterogeneity. Although over 50 genes have been associated with DCM, these collectively explain 35% of idiopathic DCM cases. Variants in the FBN1 gene encoding fibrillin-1 are primarily linked to connective tissue disorders. Considering the potential of these disorders to impact myocardial tissue, this study probes into the possible association between FBN1 variants and DCM. Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between FBN1 variants and DCM in a Chinese Han population. Methods and Results: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify rare FBN1 variants among 1,059 DCM cases and 514 controls. Utilizing a case-control strategy and the optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O), we found a significant enrichment of rare deleterious FBN1 variants in DCM patients (19 of 1,059 vs. 0 of 514, PSKAT-O = 7.49E-04). Clinical characteristics analysis indicated a higher occurrence of atrial fibrillation and a higher rate of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation among DCM patients carrying FBN1 variants (FBN1+) compared to non-carriers (FBN1-). However, these FBN1 variants did not significantly affect primary endpoints, defined as cardiac mortality or heart transplantation, yet appeared to increase the risk of secondary endpoints, including all-cause mortality or heart failure recurrence. Conclusion: The findings suggest an association between rare deleterious variants in the FBN1 gene and DCM in a Chinese Han population. Our findings underline the importance of further research to validate these results and elucidate the role of FBN1 in DCM. Potential Impact of the findings: This research provides fresh insights into the potential role of FBN1 rare variants in DCM, pointing to new directions for future genetic studies and potential therapeutic strategies in DCM management. © The Author(s) 2023.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-sequencing studies have revealed dozens of genes frequently mutated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, but few genes are associated with patients' clinical outcomes. Novel prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed in the clinic. We collected both somatic mutations and clinical information of 442 Chinese esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients from four published studies. Survival analysis was performed to reveal the clinical significance of the mutated genes. Dysregulation of the mutated genes was observed from public gene-expression data sets and its effects on cell migration and invasion were investigated with siRNA-mediated silencing. Our integrated analysis revealed 26 genes significantly and frequently mutated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Importantly, mutations in ZFHX4, SPHKAP, NRXN1, KIAA1109, DNAH5 and KCNH7 were associated with poor survival. In addition, ZFHX4 was overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal controls, and knockdown of ZFHX4 in vitro significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion. Mutations in ZFHX4 were strongly associated with poor prognosis and the down-regulation of ZFHX4 inhibits the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the prognostic values of ZFHX4 in a prospective study. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "To use next-generation sequencing technology such as RNA-seq for medical and health applications, choosing proper analysis methods for biomarker identification remains a critical challenge for most users. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has led the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project to conduct a comprehensive investigation of 278 representative RNA-seq data analysis pipelines consisting of 13 sequence mapping, three quantification, and seven normalization methods. In this article, we focused on the impact of the joint effects of RNA-seq pipelines on gene expression estimation as well as the downstream prediction of disease outcomes. First, we developed and applied three metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, and reliability) to quantitatively evaluate each pipeline’s performance on gene expression estimation. We then investigated the correlation between the proposed metrics and the downstream prediction performance using two real-world cancer datasets (i.e., SEQC neuroblastoma dataset and the NIH/NCI TCGA lung adenocarcinoma dataset). We found that RNA-seq pipeline components jointly and significantly impacted the accuracy of gene expression estimation, and its impact was extended to the downstream prediction of these cancer outcomes. Specifically, RNA-seq pipelines that produced more accurate, precise, and reliable gene expression estimation tended to perform better in the prediction of disease outcome. In the end, we provided scenarios as guidelines for users to use these three metrics to select sensible RNA-seq pipelines for the improved accuracy, precision, and reliability of gene expression estimation, which lead to the improved downstream gene expression-based prediction of disease outcome. © 2020, The Author(s).",

To understand host responses to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we combined transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify molecular markers in peripheral blood and plasma samples of 66 COVID-19-infected patients experiencing a range of disease severities and 17 healthy controls. A large number of expressed genes, proteins, metabolites, and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) exhibit strong associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients suggesting a potential impact on tissue function. Chronic activation of neutrophils, IFN-I signaling, and a high level of inflammatory cytokines were observed in patients with severe disease progression. In contrast, COVID-19-infected patients experiencing milder disease symptoms showed robust T-cell responses. Finally, we identified genes, proteins, and exRNAs as potential biomarkers that might assist in predicting the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data refine our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical progress of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors",

Based on the mRNA sequence of human NMDAR1 gene, we predicted the structure of the antigenic domains in the extracellular part of the protein using the \"phyre2\" software. Primers were designed to amplify the nucleic acid fragments encoding the NMDAR1 extracellular antigenic domains by RT-PCR. The amplified gene fragments were cloned into pCold-SUMO vector to construct the recombinant plasmids which were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. The positive colonies harboring the recombinant plasmids were picked and verified by PCR and DNA sequencing. Then, the recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and induced by IPTG for protein expression. The recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The target proteins were further purified by removing the 6 His-SUMO tag using enzyme excision followed by gel filtration chromatography using AKTA purifier. The purity of the recombinant proteins were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and the immunoreactivity were characterized by Western blotting. Three DNA fragments encoding the extracellular domains of NMDAR1 protein, including NR1-M1 (encoding 19-393 aa), NR1-S1 (encoding 394-544 aa) and NR1-S2 (encoding 663-800 aa), were amplified by RT-PCR. The NR1-S1 and NR1-S2 were linked with G (arginine) and T (threonine) amino acid as a combined fragment. The NR1-M1 and NR1-S1-GT-S2 fragments were cloned into pCold-SUMO vector and two recombinant plasmids, pCold-SUMO-M1 and pCold-SUMO-S1-GT-S2, were generated and expressed in E. coli. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the recombinant plasmids expressed soluble NR1-M1 and NR1-S1-GT-S2 proteins in bacterial. After affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography, we obtained high purity target proteins. Western blotting assay showed that the recombinant proteins NR1-M1 and NR1-S1-GT-S2 can bind specially with their corresponding antibodies, suggesting the recombinant proteins retained antigenic reactivity. We constructed a prokaryotic expression system for expressing the NMDAR1 protein extracellular parts that had immunoreactivity successfully, and the purified proteins can be used for studying NMDAR1 function and testing the autoantibodies. © 2017, Science Press.

However, the knowledge about its microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns across multiple organs and various developmental stages is still limited. Here, we constructed a comprehensive rat miRNA expression BodyMap using a diverse collection of 320 RNA samples from 11 organs of both sexes of juvenile, adolescent, adult and aged Fischer 344 rats with four biological replicates per group. Following the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA protocol, an average of 5.1 million 50 bp single-end reads was generated per sample, yielding a total of 1.6 billion reads. The quality of the resulting miRNA-seq data was deemed to be high from raw sequences, mapped sequences, and biological reproducibility. Importantly, aliquots of the same RNA samples have previously been used to construct the mRNA BodyMap. The currently presented miRNA-seq dataset along with the existing mRNA-seq dataset from the same RNA samples provides a unique resource for studying the expression characteristics of existing and novel miRNAs, and for integrative analysis of miRNA-mRNA interactions, thereby facilitating better utilization of rats for biomarker discovery. © 2022, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Glioma undergoes adaptive changes, leading to poor prognosis and resistance to treatment. CD99 influences the migration and invasion of glioma cells and plays an oncogene role. However, whether CD99 can affect the adaptiveness of gliomas is still lacking in research, making its clinical value underestimated. Here, we enrolled our in-house and public multiomics datasets for bioinformatic analysis and conducted immunohistochemistry staining to investigate the role of CD99 in glioma adaptive response and its clinical implications. CD99 is expressed in more adaptative glioma subtypes and cell states. Under hypoxic conditions, CD99 is upregulated in glioma cells and is associated with angiogenesis and metabolic adaptations. Gliomas with over-expressed CD99 also increased the immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages. The relevance with tumor adaptiveness of CD99 presented clinical significance. We discovered that CD99 overexpression is associated with short-time recurrence and validated its prognostic value. Additionally, Glioma patients with high expression of CD99 were resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The CD99 expression was also related to anti-angiogenic and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response. Inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT pathway have therapeutic potential against CD99-overexpressing gliomas. Our study identified CD99 as a biomarker characterizing the adaptive response in glioma. Gliomas with high CD99 expression are highly tolerant to stress conditions such as hypoxia and antitumor immunity, making treatment responses dimmer and tumor progression. Therefore, for patients with CD99-overexpressing gliomas, tumor adaptiveness should be fully considered during treatment to avoid drug resistance, and closer clinical monitoring should be carried out to improve the prognosis. © 2023",

We constructed a Rat Transcriptome Re-annotation named RTR using RNA-seq data from 320 samples in 11 different organs generated by the SEQC consortium. Totally, there are 52 807 genes and 114 152 transcripts in RTR. Transcribed regions and exons in RTR account for ∼42% and ∼6.5% of the genome, respectively. Of all 73 074 newly annotated transcripts in RTR, 34 213 were annotated as high confident coding transcripts and 24 728 as high confident long noncoding transcripts. Different tissues rather than different stages have a significant influence on the expression patterns of transcripts. We also found that 11 715 genes and 15 852 transcripts were expressed in all 11 tissues and that 849 house-keeping genes expressed different isoforms among tissues.

    "abstract": "Background: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains one of the world’s most known aggressive malignancies with a high mortality rate. Molecular biological analysis and bioinformatics are of great importance as they have recently occupied a large area in the studies related to the identification of various biomarkers to predict survival for LUAD patients. In our study, we attempted to identify a new prognostic model by developing a new algorithm to calculate the allele frequency deviation (AFD), which in turn may assist in the early diagnosis and prediction of clinical outcomes in LUAD. Method: First, a new algorithm was developed to calculate AFD using the whole-exome sequencing (WES) dataset. Then, AFD was measured for 102 patients, and the predictive power of AFD was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC). Finally, multivariable cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the independence of AFD as an independent prognostic tool. Result: The Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that AFD effectively segregated patients with LUAD into high-AFD-value and low-AFD-value risk groups (hazard ratio HR = 1.125, 95% confidence interval CI 1.001–1.26, p = 0.04) in the training group. Moreover, the overall survival (OS) of patients who belong to the high-AFD-value group was significantly shorter than that of patients who belong to the low-AFD-value group with 42.8% higher risk and 10% lower risk of death for both groups respectively (HR for death = 1.10; 95% CI 1.01–1.2, p = 0.03) in the training group. Similar results were obtained in the validation group (HR = 4.62, 95% CI 1.22–17.4, p = 0.02) with 41.6%, and 5.5% risk of death for patients who belong to the high and low-AFD-value groups respectively. Univariate and multivariable cox regression analyses demonstrated that AFD is an independent prognostic model for patients with LUAD. The AUC for 5-year survival were 0.712 and 0.86 in the training and validation groups, respectively. Conclusion: AFD was identified as a new independent prognostic model that could provide a prognostic tool for physicians and contribute to treatment decisions. © 2021, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that thrives in diverse environments and causes a variety of human infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa AG1 (PaeAG1) is a high-risk sequence type 111 (ST-111) strain isolated from a Costa Rican hospital in 2010. PaeAG1 has both blaVIM-2 and blaIMP-18 genes encoding for metallo-β-lactamases, and it is resistant to β-lactams (including carbapenems), aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is an antibiotic commonly used to treat P. aeruginosa infections, and it is known to produce DNA damage, triggering a complex molecular response. In order to evaluate the effects of a sub-inhibitory CIP concentration on PaeAG1, growth curves using increasing CIP concentrations were compared. We then measured gene expression using RNA-Seq at three time points (0, 2.5 and 5 h) after CIP exposure to identify the transcriptomic determinants of the response (i.e. hub genes, gene clusters and enriched pathways). Changes in expression were determined using differential expression analysis and network analysis using a top–down systems biology approach. A hybrid model using database-based and co-expression analysis approaches was implemented to predict gene–gene interactions. We observed a reduction of the growth curve rate as the sub-inhibitory CIP concentrations were increased. In the transcriptomic analysis, we detected that over time CIP treatment resulted in the differential expression of 518 genes, showing a complex impact at the molecular level. The transcriptomic determinants were 14 hub genes, multiple gene clusters at different levels (associated to hub genes or as co-expression modules) and 15 enriched pathways. Down-regulation of genes implicated in several metabolism pathways, virulence elements and ribosomal activity was observed. In contrast, amino acid catabolism, RpoS factor, proteases, and phenazines genes were up-regulated. Remarkably, > 80 resident-phage genes were up-regulated after CIP treatment, which was validated at phenomic level using a phage plaque assay. Thus, reduction of the growth curve rate and increasing phage induction was evidenced as the CIP concentrations were increased. In summary, transcriptomic and network analyses, as well as the growth curves and phage plaque assays provide evidence that PaeAG1 presents a complex, concentration-dependent response to sub-inhibitory CIP exposure, showing pleiotropic effects at the systems level. Manipulation of these determinants, such as phage genes, could be used to gain more insights about the regulation of responses in PaeAG1 as well as the identification of possible therapeutic targets. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the transcriptomic analysis of CIP response in a ST-111 high-risk P. aeruginosa strain, in particular using a top-down systems biology approach. © 2020, The Author(s).",

Accurate molecular classification is urgently required for guiding precision treatment. We established a large-scale multi-omics cohort of 579 patients with HR+/HER2− breast cancer and identified the following four molecular subtypes: canonical luminal, immunogenic, proliferative and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-driven. Tumors of these four subtypes showed distinct biological and clinical features, suggesting subtype-specific therapeutic strategies. The RTK-driven subtype was characterized by the activation of the RTK pathways and associated with poor outcomes. The immunogenic subtype had enriched immune cells and could benefit from immune checkpoint therapy. In addition, we developed convolutional neural network models to discriminate these subtypes based on digital pathology for potential clinical translation. The molecular classification provides insights into molecular heterogeneity and highlights the potential for precision treatment of HR+/HER2− breast cancer. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",

To optimally serve these goals, it is essential that the mouse model faithfully recapitulates the human disease. Recently, novel mouse models for neuroblastoma have been developed. Here, we report on the further genomic characterization through exome sequencing and DNA copy number analysis of four of the currently available murine neuroblastoma model systems (ALK, Th-MYCN, Dbh-MYCN and Lin28b). The murine tumors revealed a low number of genomic alterations - in keeping with human neuroblastoma - and a positive correlation of the number of genetic lesions with the time to onset of tumor formation was observed. Gene copy number alterations are the hallmark of both murine and human disease and frequently affect syntenic genomic regions. Despite low mutational load, the genes mutated in murine disease were found to be enriched for genes mutated in human disease. Taken together, our study further supports the validity of the tested mouse models for mechanistic and preclinical studies of human neuroblastoma. © De Wilde et al.",

Our previous mechanistic studies revealed that autophagy, disturbance of calcium homeostasis, and ER stress are involved in usnic acid-induced toxicity. In this study, we investigated the role of oxidative stress and the Nrf2 signaling pathway in usnic acid-induced toxicity in HepG2 cells. We found that a 24-h treatment with usnic acid caused DNA damage and S-phase cell cycle arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. Usnic acid also triggered oxidative stress as demonstrated by increased reactive oxygen species generation and glutathione depletion. Short-term treatment (6 h) with usnic acid significantly increased the protein level for Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), promoted Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, up-regulated antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity, and induced the expression of Nrf2-regulated targets, including glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). Furthermore, knockdown of Nrf2 with shRNA potentiated usnic acid-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results show that usnic acid causes cell cycle dysregulation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress and that the Nrf2 signaling pathway is activated in usnic acid-induced cytotoxicity. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).",

Female schistosomes rely on a unique male-induced strategy to accomplish reproductive development, a process that is incompletely understood. Here we map detailed transcriptomic profiles of male and female Schistosoma japonicum across eight time points throughout the sexual developmental process from pairing to maturation. The dynamic gene expression pattern data reveal clear sex-related characteristics, indicative of an unambiguous functional division between males and females during their interplay. Cluster analysis, in situ hybridization and RNAi assays indicate that males likely use biogenic amine neurotransmitters through the nervous system to control and maintain pairing with females. In addition, the analyses indicate that reproductive development of females involves an insect-like hormonal regulation. These data sets and analyses serve as a foundation for deeper study of sexual development in this pathogen and identification of novel anti-schistosomal interventions. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Leflunomide, used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has been reported to cause severe liver problems and liver failure; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we used multiple approaches including genomic analysis to investigate and characterize the possible molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxicity of leflunomide in hepatic cells. We found that leflunomide caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated an unfolded protein response, as evidenced by increased expression of related genes including CHOP and GADD34; and elevated protein levels of typical ER stress markers including CHOP, ATF-4, p-eIF2α and spliced XBP1. The secretion of Gaussia luciferase was suppressed in cells treated with leflunomide in an ER stress reporter assay. Inhibition of ER stress with an ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate, and knockdown of ATF-4 and CHOP genes partially protected cells upon leflunomide exposure. In addition, both genomic and biochemical analyses revealed that JNK and ERK1/2 of MAPK signaling pathways were activated, and both contributed to the leflunomide-induced cytotoxicity. Inhibiting JNK activation using a JNK inhibitor attenuated the ER stress and cytotoxicity of leflunomide, whereas inhibiting ERK1/2 using an ERK1/2 inhibitor or ERK1/2 siRNA increased the adverse effect caused by leflunomide, suggesting opposite roles for the two pathways. In summary, our data indicate that both ER stress and the activation of JNK and ERK1/2 contribute to leflunomide-induced cytotoxicity. © 2017",

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure. Yet the mechanisms underlying adaptive tolerance toward APAP-induced liver injury are not fully understood. To better understand molecular mechanisms contributing to adaptive tolerance to APAP is an underpinning foundation for APAP-related precision medicine. In the current study, the mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles derived from next generation sequencing data for APAP-treated (5 and 10 mM) HepaRG cells and controls were analyzed systematically. Putative miRNAs targeting key dysregulated genes involved in APAP hepatotoxicity were selected using in silico prediction algorithms, un-biased gene ontology, and network analyses. Luciferase reporter assays, RNA electrophoresis mobility shift assays, and miRNA pull-down assays were performed to investigate the role of miRNAs affecting the expression of dysregulated genes. Levels of selected miRNAs were measured in serum samples obtained from children with APAP overdose (58.6–559.4 mg/kg) and from healthy controls. As results, 2758 differentially expressed genes and 47 miRNAs were identified. Four of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-224-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-449a, and hsa-miR-877-5p) suppressed drug metabolizing enzyme (DME) levels involved in APAP-induced liver injury by downregulating HNF1A, HNF4A and NR1I2 expression. Exogenous transfection of these miRNAs into HepaRG cells effectively rescued them from APAP toxicity, as indicated by decreased alanine aminotransferase levels. Importantly, hsa-miR-320a and hsa-miR-877-5p levels were significantly elevated in serum samples obtained from children with APAP overdose compared to health controls. Collectively, these data indicate that hsa-miR-224-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-449a, and hsa-miR-877-5p suppress DME expression involved in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and they contribute to an adaptive response in hepatocytes. © 2017, US Government (outside the USA).",

    "abstract": "Accurate indel calling plays an important role in precision medicine. A benchmarking indel set is essential for thoroughly evaluating the indel calling performance of bioinformatics pipelines. A reference sample with a set of known-positive variants was developed in the FDA-led Sequencing Quality Control Phase 2 (SEQC2) project, but the known indels in the known-positive set were limited. This project sought to provide an enriched set of known indels that would be more translationally relevant by focusing on additional cancer related regions. A thorough manual review process completed by 42 reviewers, two advisors, and a judging panel of three researchers significantly enriched the known indel set by an additional 516 indels. The extended benchmarking indel set has a large range of variant allele frequencies (VAFs), with 87% of them having a VAF below 20% in reference Sample A. The reference Sample A and the indel set can be used for comprehensive benchmarking of indel calling across a wider range of VAF values in the lower range. Indel length was also variable, but the majority were under 10 base pairs (bps). Most of the indels were within coding regions, with the remainder in the gene regulatory regions. Although high confidence can be derived from the robust study design and meticulous human review, this extensive indel set has not undergone orthogonal validation. The extended benchmarking indel set, along with the indels in the previously published known-positive set, was the truth set used to benchmark indel calling pipelines in a community challenge hosted on the precisionFDA platform. This benchmarking indel set and reference samples can be utilized for a comprehensive evaluation of indel calling pipelines. Additionally, the insights and solutions obtained during the manual review process can aid in improving the performance of these pipelines. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.",

    "abstract": "We present a global atlas of 4,728 metagenomic samples from mass-transit systems in 60 cities over 3 years, representing the first systematic, worldwide catalog of the urban microbial ecosystem. This atlas provides an annotated, geospatial profile of microbial strains, functional characteristics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) markers, and genetic elements, including 10,928 viruses, 1,302 bacteria, 2 archaea, and 838,532 CRISPR arrays not found in reference databases. We identified 4,246 known species of urban microorganisms and a consistent set of 31 species found in 97% of samples that were distinct from human commensal organisms. Profiles of AMR genes varied widely in type and density across cities. Cities showed distinct microbial taxonomic signatures that were driven by climate and geographic differences. These results constitute a high-resolution global metagenomic atlas that enables discovery of organisms and genes, highlights potential public health and forensic applications, and provides a culture-independent view of AMR burden in cities. © 2021 The Author(s)",

Here, we perform a genome-scale screen to measure gRNA activity for two highly specific SpCas9 variants (eSpCas9(1.1) and SpCas9-HF1) and wild-type SpCas9 (WT-SpCas9) in human cells, and obtain indel rates of over 50,000 gRNAs for each nuclease, covering ~20,000 genes. We evaluate the contribution of 1,031 features to gRNA activity and develope models for activity prediction. Our data reveals that a combination of RNN with important biological features outperforms other models for activity prediction. We further demonstrate that our model outperforms other popular gRNA design tools. Finally, we develop an online design tool DeepHF for the three Cas9 nucleases.

    "abstract": "Background: Drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMETs) play crucial roles in drug absorption and disposition. Species differences in the interaction of compounds with DMETs may contribute to the accuracy of animal models in predicting human responses in clinical studies. Thus it is important to clarify the expression heterogeneity of DMETs between human and rat, that is commonly used as a model for evaluating drug efficacy and drug safety. Methods: We compared the expression patterns of DMETs based on a rat RNA-seq dataset and the human Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets. A relatively high correlation of expression of DMETs between rat and human was observed in most organs, while a lower correlation was detected in the liver and kidney; however, a greater number of genes were variably expressed in the latter two organs. We characterized the basal expression traits of DMETs in rat in terms of organ, sex, and developmental differences. Results: Co-expressed modules across organs of DMETs were identified to include potential function-ally-related genes. Interestingly, most of these modules showed liver-and/or kidney-specific expression. Moreover, we identified DMETs modules that were highly correlated to sex or developmental stages. Finally, we created networks containing sex and/or developmentally-related drugs and diseases with their related DMETs to display the clinical significance of sexually dimorphic and/or develop-mentally-specific DMET genes. Conclusion: Our study provides a deeper understanding of species differences in not only DMETs but specific susceptibility to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.",

Omics reference materials play a pivotal role in ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and comparability of laboratory measurements and analyses. However, the current application of omics reference materials has revealed several issues, including inappropriate selection and underutilization, leading to inconsistencies across laboratories. This review aims to address these concerns by emphasizing the importance of well-characterized reference materials at each level of omics, encompassing (epi-)genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. By summarizing their characteristics, advantages, and limitations along with appropriate performance metrics pertinent to study purposes, we provide an overview of how omics reference materials can enhance data quality and data integration, thus fostering robust scientific investigations with omics technologies. © The Author(s) 2024.",

However, the inherent limitations of short reads make accurate inference of diplotypes still challenging, which may reduce the effectiveness of genotype-guided drug therapy. Methods: An automated Pharmacogenomics Annotation tool (PAnno) was implemented, which reports prescribing recommendations and phenotypes by parsing the germline variant call format (VCF) file from NGS and the population to which the individual belongs. Results: A ranking model dedicated to inferring diplotypes, developed based on the allele (haplotype) definition and population allele frequency, was introduced in PAnno. The predictive performance was validated in comparison with four similar tools using the consensus diplotype data of the Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program (GeT-RM) as ground truth. An annotation method was proposed to summarize prescribing recommendations and classify drugs into avoid use, use with caution, and routine use, following the recommendations of the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), etc. It further predicts phenotypes of specific drugs in terms of toxicity, dosage, efficacy, and metabolism by integrating the high-confidence clinical annotations in the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB). PAnno is available at https://github.com/PreMedKB/PAnno. Discussion: PAnno provides an end-to-end clinical pharmacogenomics decision support solution by resolving, annotating, and reporting germline variants.

    "abstract": "Emerging technologies are playing a major role in the generation of new approaches to assess the safety of both foods and drugs. However, the integration of emerging technologies in the regulatory decision-making process requires rigorous assessment and consensus amongst international partners and research communities. To that end, the Global Coalition for Regulatory Science Research (GCRSR) in partnership with the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) hosted the seventh Global Summit on Regulatory Science (GSRS17) in Brasilia, Brazil on September 18–20, 2017 to discuss the role of new approaches in regulatory science with a specific emphasis on applications in food and medical product safety. The global regulatory landscape concerning the application of new technologies was assessed in several countries worldwide. Challenges and issues were discussed in the context of developing an international consensus for objective criteria in the development, application and review of emerging technologies. The need for advanced approaches to allow for faster, less expensive and more predictive methodologies was elaborated. In addition, the strengths and weaknesses of each new approach was discussed. And finally, the need for standards and reproducible approaches was reviewed to enhance the application of the emerging technologies to improve food and drug safety. The overarching goal of GSRS17 was to provide a venue where regulators and researchers meet to develop collaborations addressing the most pressing scientific challenges and facilitate the adoption of novel technical innovations to advance the field of regulatory science. © 2018",

    "abstract": "The advent of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in modern oncology has significantly improved survival in several cancer settings. A subgroup of women with breast cancer (BC) has immunogenic infiltration of lymphocytes with expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). These patients may potentially benefit from ICI targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 signaling axis. The use of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as predictive and prognostic biomarkers has been under intense examination. Emerging data suggest that TILs are associated with response to both cytotoxic treatments and immunotherapy, particularly for patients with triple-negative BC. In this review from The International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group, we discuss (a) the biological understanding of TILs, (b) their analytical and clinical validity and efforts toward the clinical utility in BC, and (c) the current status of PD-L1 and TIL testing across different continents, including experiences from low-to-middle-income countries, incorporating also the view of a patient advocate.

    "abstract": "The lack of samples for generating standardized DNA datasets for setting up a sequencing pipeline or benchmarking the performance of different algorithms limits the implementation and uptake of cancer genomics. Here, we describe reference call sets obtained from paired tumor–normal genomic DNA (gDNA) samples derived from a breast cancer cell line—which is highly heterogeneous, with an aneuploid genome, and enriched in somatic alterations—and a matched lymphoblastoid cell line. We partially validated both somatic mutations and germline variants in these call sets via whole-exome sequencing (WES) with different sequencing platforms and targeted sequencing with >2,000-fold coverage, spanning 82% of genomic regions with high confidence. Although the gDNA reference samples are not representative of primary cancer cells from a clinical sample, when setting up a sequencing pipeline, they not only minimize potential biases from technologies, assays and informatics but also provide a unique resource for benchmarking ‘tumor-only’ or ‘matched tumor–normal’ analyses. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",

    "abstract": "Sericinus montelus (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae, Parnassiinae) is a high-value ornamental swallowtail butterfly species widely distributed in Northern and Central China, Japan, Korea, and Russia. The larval stage of this species feeds exclusively on Aristolochia plants. The Aristolochia species is well known for its high levels of aristolochic acids (AAs), which have been found to be carcinogenic for numerous animals. The swallowtail butterfly is among the few that can feed on these toxic host plants. However, the genetic adaptation of S. montelus to confer new abilities for AA tolerance has not yet been well explored, largely due to the limited genomic resources of this species. This study aimed to present a chromosome-level reference genome for S. montelus using the Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, Illumina short-read sequencing, and Hi-C technology. The final assembly was composed of 581.44 Mb with an expected genome size of 619.27 Mb. Further, 99.98% of the bases could be anchored onto 30 chromosomes. The N50 of contigs and scaffolds was 5.74 and 19.12 Mb, respectively. Approximately 48.86% of the assembled genome was suggested to be repeat elements, and 13,720 protein-coding genes were predicted in the current assembly. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that S. montelus diverged from the common ancestor of swallowtails about 58.57–80.46 million years ago. Compared with related species, S. montelus showed a significant expansion of P450 gene family members, and positive selections on eloa, heatr1, and aph1a resulted in the AA tolerance for S. montelus larva. The de novo assembly of a high-quality reference genome for S. montelus provided a fundamental genomic tool for future research on evolution, genome genetics, and toxicology of the swallowtail butterflies.

    "abstract": "Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) are essential for understanding the role of DNA methylation changes in genetic predisposition, yet they have not been fully characterized in East Asians (EAs). Here we identified mQTLs in whole blood from 3,523 Chinese individuals and replicated them in additional 1,858 Chinese individuals from two cohorts. Over 9% of mQTLs displayed specificity to EAs, facilitating the fine-mapping of EA-specific genetic associations, as shown for variants associated with height. Trans-mQTL hotspots revealed biological pathways contributing to EA-specific genetic associations, including an ERG-mediated 233 trans-mCpG network, implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation, which likely reflects binding efficiency modulation of the ERG protein complex. More than 90% of mQTLs were shared between different blood cell lineages, with a smaller fraction of lineage-specific mQTLs displaying preferential hypomethylation in the respective lineages. Our study provides new insights into the mQTL landscape across genetic ancestries and their downstream effects on cellular processes and diseases/traits. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. 2024.",

HRD is found in a subgroup of cancer patients for several tumor types, and it has a clinical relevance to cancer prevention and therapies. Accumulating evidence has identified HRD as a biomarker for assessing the therapeutic response of tumor cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapies. Nevertheless, the biology of HRD is complex, and its applications and the benefits of different HRD biomarker assays are controversial. This is primarily due to inconsistencies in HRD assessments and definitions (gene-level tests, genomic scars, mutational signatures, or a combination of these methods) and difficulties in assessing the contribution of each genomic event. Therefore, we aim to review the biological rationale and clinical evidence of HRD as a biomarker. This review provides a blueprint for the standardization and harmonization of HRD assessments. © 2023 The Authors",

    "abstract": "Background: Genomic DNA reference materials are widely recognized as essential for ensuring data quality in omics research. However, relying solely on reference datasets to evaluate the accuracy of variant calling results is incomplete, as they are limited to benchmark regions. Therefore, it is important to develop DNA reference materials that enable the assessment of variant detection performance across the entire genome. Results: We established a DNA reference material suite from four immortalized cell lines derived from a family of parents and monozygotic twins. Comprehensive reference datasets of 4.2 million small variants and 15,000 structural variants were integrated and certified for evaluating the reliability of germline variant calls inside the benchmark regions. Importantly, the genetic built-in-truth of the Quartet family design enables estimation of the precision of variant calls outside the benchmark regions. Using the Quartet reference materials along with study samples, batch effects are objectively monitored and alleviated by training a machine learning model with the Quartet reference datasets to remove potential artifact calls. Moreover, the matched RNA and protein reference materials and datasets from the Quartet project enables cross-omics validation of variant calls from multiomics data. Conclusions: The Quartet DNA reference materials and reference datasets provide a unique resource for objectively assessing the quality of germline variant calls throughout the whole-genome regions and improving the reliability of large-scale genomic profiling. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Metrology is the science of measurement and its applications, whereas biometrology is the science of biological measurement and its applications. Biometrology aims to achieve accuracy and consistency of biological measurements by focusing on the development of metrological traceability, biological reference measurement procedures, and reference materials. Irreproducibility of biological and multi-omics research results from different laboratories, platforms, and analysis methods is hampering the translation of research into clinical uses and can often be attributed to the lack of biologists’ attention to the general principles of metrology. In this paper, the progresses of biometrology including metrology on nucleic acid, protein, and cell measurements and its impacts on the improvement of reliability and comparability in biological research are reviewed. Challenges in obtaining more reliable biological and multi-omics measurements due to the lack of primary reference measurement procedures and new standards for biological reference materials faced by biometrology are discussed. In the future, in addition to establishing reliable reference measurement procedures, developing reference materials from single or multiple parameters to multi-omics scale should be emphasized. Thinking in way of biometrology is warranted for facilitating the translation of high-throughput omics research into clinical practices.

    "abstract": "Background: The overall 5-year survival of lung cancer was reported to be only ~15%, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) as the main pathological subtype. Before developing into invasive stages, LUAD undergoes pre-invasive stages of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), where surgical resection gives an excellent 5-year survival rate. Given the dramatic decline of prognosis from pre-invasive to invasive stages, a deeper understanding of key molecular changes driving the progression of LUAD is highly needed. Methods: In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing on surgically resected 24 AIS, 74 MIA, 99 LUAD specimens, and their adjacent paired normal tissues. Survival data were obtained by follow-up after surgery. Key molecular events were found by comparing the gene expression profiles of tumors with different stages. Finally, to measure the level of imbalance between tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune microenvironment, a tumor progressive (TP) index was developed to predict tumor progression and patients’ survival outcome and validated by external datasets. Results: As tumors progressed to more invasive stages, they acquired higher growth potential, mutational frequency of tumor suppressor genes, somatic copy number alterations, and tumor mutation burden, along with suppressed immune function. To better predict tumor progression and patients’ outcome, TP index were built to measure the imbalance between tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune microenvironment. Patients with a higher TP index had significantly worse recurrence-free survival [Hazard ratio (HR), 10.47; 95% CI, 3.21–34.14; p < 0.0001] and overall survival (OS) [Hazard ratio (HR), 4.83e8; 95% CI, 0–Inf; p = 0.0013]. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD dataset for validation and found that patients with a higher TP index had significantly worse OS (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83–1.45; p = 0.048), demonstrating the prognostic value of the TP index for patients with LUAD. Conclusions: The imbalance of tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune function orchestrate the progression of LUAD, which can be measured by TP index. Our study provided new insights into predicting survival of patients with LUAD and new target discovery for LUAD through assessing the imbalance between tumor intrinsic growth potential and immune function.

    "abstract": "Due to the tolerance of mismatches between gRNA and targeting sequence, base editors frequently induce unwanted Cas9-dependent off-target mutations. Here, to develop models to predict such off-targets, we design gRNA-off- target pairs for adenine base editors (ABEs) and cytosine base editors (CBEs) and stably integrate them into the human cells. After five days of editing, we obtain valid efficiency datasets of 54,663 and 55,727 off-targets for ABEs and CBEs, respectively. We use the datasets to train deep learning models, resulting in ABEdeepoff and CBEdeepoff, which can predict off-target sites. We use these tools to predict off-targets for a panel of endogenous loci and achieve Spearman correlation values varying from 0.710 to 0.859. Finally, we develop an integrated tool that is freely accessible via an online web server http://www.deephf.com/#/bedeep/bedeepoff . These tools could facilitate minimizing the off-target effects of base editing. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ground-glass opacity (GGO)-like lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been detected increasingly in the clinic and its inert property and superior survival indicate unique biological characteristics. However, we do not know much about them, which hampers identification of key reasons for the inert property of GGO-like LUAD. Methods: Using whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing, taking into account both radiological and pathological classifications of the same 197 patients concomitantly, we systematically interrogate genes driving the progression from GGO to solid nodule and potential reasons for the inertia of GGO. Using flow cytometry and IHC, we validated the abundance of immune cells and activity of cell proliferation. Findings: Identifying the differences between GGO and solid nodule, we found adenocarcinoma in situ/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (AIS/MIA) and GGO-like LUAD exhibited lower TP53 mutation frequency and less active cell proliferation-related pathways than solid nodule in LUAD. Identifying the differences in GGO between AIS/MIA and LUAD, we noticed that EGFR mutation frequency and CNV load were significantly higher in LUAD than in AIS/MIA. Regulatory T cell was also higher in LUAD, while CD8+ T cell decreased from AIS/MIA to LUAD. Finally, we constructed a transcriptomic signature to quantify the development from GGO to solid nodule, which was an independent predictor of patients’ prognosis in 11 external LUAD datasets. Interpretation: Our results provide deeper insights into the indolent nature of GGO and provide a molecular basis for the treatment of GGO-like LUAD.

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNAseq) technology has become increasingly important in precision medicine and clinical diagnostics, and emerged as a powerful tool for identifying protein-coding genes, performing differential gene analysis, and inferring immune cell composition. Human peripheral blood samples are widely used for RNAseq, providing valuable insights into individual biomolecular information. Blood samples can be classified as whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, and remaining sediment samples, including plasma-free blood (PFB) and serum-free blood (SFB) samples that are generally considered less useful byproducts during the processes of plasma and serum separation, respectively. However, the feasibility of using PFB and SFB samples for transcriptome analysis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the suitability of employing PFB or SFB samples as an alternative RNA source in transcriptomic analysis. We performed a comparative analysis of WB, PFB, and SFB samples for different applications. Our results revealed that PFB samples exhibit greater similarity to WB samples than SFB samples in terms of protein-coding gene expression patterns, detection of differentially expressed genes, and immunological characterizations, suggesting that PFB can serve as a viable alternative to WB for transcriptomic analysis. Our study contributes to the optimization of blood sample utilization and the advancement of precision medicine research. © The Author(s) 2023.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The tumor microenvironment has a profound impact on prognosis and immunotherapy. However, the landscape of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) microenvironment has not been fully understood. Experimental Design: Using the largest original multi-omics dataset of TNBC (n = 386), we conducted an extensive immunogenomic analysis to explore the heterogeneity and prognostic significance of the TNBC microenvironment. We further analyzed the potential immune escape mechanisms of TNBC. Results: The TNBC microenvironment phenotypes were classified into three heterogeneous clusters: cluster 1, the \"immune-desert\" cluster, with low microenvironment cell infiltration; cluster 2, the \"innate immune-inactivated\" cluster, with resting innate immune cells and nonimmune stromal cells infiltration; and cluster 3, the \"immune-inflamed\" cluster, with abundant adaptive and innate immune cells infiltration. The clustering result was validated internally with pathologic sections and externally with The Cancer Genome Atlas and METABRIC cohorts. The microenvironment clusters had significant prognostic efficacy. In terms of potential immune escape mechanisms, cluster 1 was characterized by an incapability to attract immune cells, and MYC amplification was correlated with low immune infiltration. In cluster 2, chemotaxis but inactivation of innate immunity and low tumor antigen burden might contribute to immune escape, and mutations in the PI3K-AKT pathway might be correlated with this effect. Cluster 3 featured high expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Conclusions: Our study represents a step toward personalized immunotherapy for patients with TNBC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors might be effective for \"immune-inflamed\" cluster, and the transformation of \"cold tumors\" into \"hot tumors\" should be considered for \"immune-desert\" and \"innate immune-inactivated\" clusters. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",

To date, no bulk sequencing study has addressed the effects of cross-site reproducibility, nor the biological, technical and computational factors that influence variant identification. Here we report a systematic interrogation of somatic mutations in paired tumor–normal cell lines to identify factors affecting detection reproducibility and accuracy at six different centers. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES), we evaluated the reproducibility of different sample types with varying input amount and tumor purity, and multiple library construction protocols, followed by processing with nine bioinformatics pipelines. We found that read coverage and callers affected both WGS and WES reproducibility, but WES performance was influenced by insert fragment size, genomic copy content and the global imbalance score (GIV; G > T/C > A). Finally, taking into account library preparation protocol, tumor content, read coverage and bioinformatics processes concomitantly, we recommend actionable practices to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of NGS experiments for cancer mutation detection. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",

    "abstract": "Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease and we have previously shown that rapid relapse of TNBC is associated with distinct sociodemographic features. We hypothesized that rapid versus late relapse in TNBC is also defined by distinct clinical and genomic features of primary tumors. Methods: Using three publicly-available datasets, we identified 453 patients diagnosed with primary TNBC with adequate follow-up to be characterized as ‘rapid relapse’ (rrTNBC; distant relapse or death ≤2 years of diagnosis), ‘late relapse’ (lrTNBC; > 2 years) or ‘no relapse’ (nrTNBC: > 5 years no relapse/death). We explored basic clinical and primary tumor multi-omic data, including whole transcriptome (n = 453), and whole genome copy number and mutation data for 171 cancer-related genes (n = 317). Association of rapid relapse with clinical and genomic features were assessed using Pearson chi-squared tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and Fisher exact tests. We evaluated logistic regression models of clinical features with subtype versus two models that integrated significant genomic features. Results: Relative to nrTNBC, both rrTNBC and lrTNBC had significantly lower immune signatures and immune signatures were highly correlated to anti-tumor CD8 T-cell, M1 macrophage, and gamma-delta T-cell CIBERSORT inferred immune subsets. Intriguingly, lrTNBCs were enriched for luminal signatures. There was no difference in tumor mutation burden or percent genome altered across groups. Logistic regression mModels that incorporate genomic features significantly outperformed standard clinical/subtype models in training (n = 63 patients), testing (n = 63) and independent validation (n = 34) cohorts, although performance of all models were overall modest.

    "abstract": "Background: Reference genome selection is a prerequisite for successful analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) data. Current practice employs one of the two most recent human reference genome versions: HG19 or HG38. To date, the impact of genome version on SNV identification has not been rigorously assessed. Methods: We conducted analysis comparing the SNVs identified based on HG19 vs HG38, leveraging whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the genome-in-a-bottle (GIAB) project. First, SNVs were called using 26 different bioinformatics pipelines with either HG19 or HG38. Next, two tools were used to convert the called SNVs between HG19 and HG38. Lastly we calculated conversion rates, analyzed discordant rates between SNVs called with HG19 or HG38, and characterized the discordant SNVs. Results: The conversion rates from HG38 to HG19 (average 95%) were lower than the conversion rates from HG19 to HG38 (average 99%). The conversion rates varied slightly among the various calling pipelines. Around 1.5% SNVs were discordantly converted between HG19 or HG38. The conversions from HG38 to HG19 had more SNVs which failed conversion and more discordant SNVs than the opposite conversion (HG19 to HG38). Most of the discordant SNVs had low read depth, were low confidence SNVs as defined by GIAB, and/or were predominated by G/C alleles (52% observed versus 42% expected). Conclusion: A significant number of SNVs could not be converted between HG19 and HG38. Based on careful review of our comparisons, we recommend HG38 (the newer version) for NGS SNV analysis. To summarize, our findings suggest caution when translating identified SNVs between different versions of the human reference genome. © 2019 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Background: Our objective was to explore the pharmacogenetic impact of three known functional variants in drug target genes and determine whether they can explain the inter-individual variation in therapeutic response. Methods: In a post hoc analysis of data from randomized controlled clinical trials of chiglitazar, we genotyped 481 Chinese patients with T2DM and investigated the association of variants in PPAR genes with the therapeutic outcome separated by dose using linear regression. Results: rs1800234, a gain-of-function variant of PPARA, had a dose-dependent pharmacogenetic impact on the therapeutic response to chiglitazar. The C allele was significantly associated with reduced therapeutic response in the 48 mg group, while no significant association was observed in the 32 mg group. In addition, in patients without the C allele, patients treated with 48 mg chiglitazar had a better therapeutic response than those treated with 32 mg chiglitazar. To the contrary, in patients with the C allele, patients treated with 48 mg chiglitazar had a worse therapeutic response than those treated with 32 mg of chiglitazar. Conclusion: The PPARA variant rs1800234 had a dose-dependent pharmacogenetic impact on the therapeutic response to chiglitazar. It could help explain the absence of a dose effect of chiglitazar and serve as a potential biomarker for the chosen dose of chiglitazar in the future.

    "abstract": "Background: Recent state-of-the-art sequencing technologies enable the investigation of challenging regions in the human genome and expand the scope of variant benchmarking datasets. Herein, we sequence a Chinese Quartet, comprising two monozygotic twin daughters and their biological parents, using four short and long sequencing platforms (Illumina, BGI, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technology). Results: The long reads from the monozygotic twin daughters are phased into paternal and maternal haplotypes using the parent–child genetic map and for each haplotype. We also use long reads to generate haplotype-resolved whole-genome assemblies with completeness and continuity exceeding that of GRCh38. Using this Quartet, we comprehensively catalogue the human variant landscape, generating a dataset of 3,962,453 SNVs, 886,648 indels (< 50 bp), 9726 large deletions (≥ 50 bp), 15,600 large insertions (≥ 50 bp), 40 inversions, 31 complex structural variants, and 68 de novo mutations which are shared between the monozygotic twin daughters. Variants underrepresented in previous benchmarks owing to their complexity—including those located at long repeat regions, complex structural variants, and de novo mutations—are systematically examined in this study. Conclusions: In summary, this study provides high-quality haplotype-resolved assemblies and a comprehensive set of benchmarking resources for two Chinese monozygotic twin samples which, relative to existing benchmarks, offers expanded genomic coverage and insight into complex variant categories. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Background: Batch effects are notoriously common technical variations in multiomics data and may result in misleading outcomes if uncorrected or over-corrected. A plethora of batch-effect correction algorithms are proposed to facilitate data integration. However, their respective advantages and limitations are not adequately assessed in terms of omics types, the performance metrics, and the application scenarios. Results: As part of the Quartet Project for quality control and data integration of multiomics profiling, we comprehensively assess the performance of seven batch effect correction algorithms based on different performance metrics of clinical relevance, i.e., the accuracy of identifying differentially expressed features, the robustness of predictive models, and the ability of accurately clustering cross-batch samples into their own donors. The ratio-based method, i.e., by scaling absolute feature values of study samples relative to those of concurrently profiled reference material(s), is found to be much more effective and broadly applicable than others, especially when batch effects are completely confounded with biological factors of study interests. We further provide practical guidelines for implementing the ratio based approach in increasingly large-scale multiomics studies. Conclusions: Multiomics measurements are prone to batch effects, which can be effectively corrected using ratio-based scaling of the multiomics data. Our study lays the foundation for eliminating batch effects at a ratio scale. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",

    "abstract": "Genotyping methods and genome sequencing are indispensable to reveal genomic structure of bacterial species displaying high level of genome plasticity. However, reconstruction of genome or assembly is not straightforward due to data complexity, including repeats, mobile and accessory genetic elements of bacterial genomes. Moreover, since the solution to this problem is strongly influenced by sequencing technology, bioinformatics pipelines, and selection criteria to assess assemblers, there is no systematic way to select a priori the optimal assembler and parameter settings. To assembly the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain AG1 (PaeAG1), short reads (Illumina) and long reads (Oxford Nanopore) sequencing data were used in 13 different non-hybrid and hybrid approaches. PaeAG1 is a multiresistant high-risk sequence type 111 (ST-111) clone that was isolated from a Costa Rican hospital and it was the first report of an isolate of P. aeruginosa carrying both blaVIM-2 and blaIMP-18 genes encoding for metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) enzymes. To assess the assemblies, multiple metrics regard to contiguity, correctness and completeness (3C criterion, as we define here) were used for benchmarking the 13 approaches and select a definitive assembly. In addition, annotation was done to identify genes (coding and RNA regions) and to describe the genomic content of PaeAG1. Whereas long reads and hybrid approaches showed better performances in terms of contiguity, higher correctness and completeness metrics were obtained for short read only and hybrid approaches. A manually curated and polished hybrid assembly gave rise to a single circular sequence with 100% of core genes and known regions identified, >98% of reads mapped back, no gaps, and uniform coverage. The strategy followed to obtain this high-quality 3C assembly is detailed in the manuscript and we provide readers with an all-in-one script to replicate our results or to apply it to other troublesome cases. The final 3C assembly revealed that the PaeAG1 genome has 7,190,208 bp, a 65.7% GC content and 6,709 genes (6,620 coding sequences), many of which are included in multiple mobile genomic elements, such as 57 genomic islands, six prophages, and two complete integrons with blaVIM-2 and blaIMP-18 MBL genes. Up to 250 and 60 of the predicted genes are anticipated to play a role in virulence (adherence, quorum sensing and secretion) or antibiotic resistance (β-lactamases, efflux pumps, etc). Altogether, the assembly and annotation of the PaeAG1 genome provide new perspectives to continue studying the genomic diversity and gene content of this important human pathogen. © 2020, The Author(s).",

We systematically compared human and mouse orthologs in terms of alternative splicing patterns and expression profiles. Human-mouse orthologs are divergent in alternative splicing, as human orthologs could generally encode more isoforms than their mouse orthologs. In early embryos, exon skipping is far more common with human orthologs, whereas constitutive exons are more prevalent with mouse orthologs. This may correlate with divergence in expression of splicing regulators. Orthologous expression similarities are different in distinct embryonic stages, with the highest in morula. Expression differences for orthologous transcription factor genes could play an important role in orthologous expression discordance. We further detected largely orthologous divergence in differential expression between distinct embryonic stages. Collectively, our study uncovers significant orthologous divergence from multiple aspects, which may result in functional differences and dynamics between human-mouse orthologs during embryonic development. © 2016, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Studies have reported alcohol consumption and genetic variants as major contributing factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the complicated interactions between alcohol and genetic factors involved in alcohol metabolism have not been well elucidated with respect to augmented risk of ESCC. Methods: We performed a large population-based case-control study in a Chinese city with a high ESCC incidence by enrolling 1190 case patients and 1883 controls. We integrated candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism data, detailed alcohol consumption records, gene-alcohol interactions, and single-nucleotide polymorphism functional information to untangle the complicated relationship between alcohol, variants of genes encoding alcohol metabolism enzymes, and ESCC risk. The gene-alcohol interaction was tested by including their product term in a multivariable logistic regression model. Synergy index and ratio of ORs were calculated to assess interaction on additive and multiplicative scale, respectively. Results: We confirmed two ESCC susceptibility loci, rs671 in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family member gene (ALDH2) and rs1042026 in alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (class I), beta polypeptide gene (ADH1B), that significantly altered alcohol consumption behavior and subsequently modified the association between alcohol consumption and ESCC risk. The rs671(A) allele was associated with ESCC risk in alcohol drinkers (adjusted odds ratio =1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51–2.60) but not in nondrinkers. Healthy individuals who carry different ALDH2 and ADH1B genotypes exhibit diversified drinking behavior, with the proportion of drinkers varying between 23.7% and 54.3%. Among individuals with a fast ethanol oxidization rate, we observed a strong interaction between heavy alcohol consumption and ethanal oxidization rate on both the additive scale (synergy index 4.80 [95% CI: 1.82–12.68]) and the multiplicative scale (ratio of ORs 2.93, 95% CI: 1.39–6.35). Conclusions: Our observation highlights the need for preventing excessive use of alcohol, especially in individuals harboring active alcohol dehyrogenase and inactive ALDH2 variants. © 2019 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",

    "abstract": "Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric malignancy with heterogeneous clinical behaviors, ranging from spontaneous regression to aggressive progression. Many studies have identified aberrations related to the pathogenesis and prognosis, broadly classifying neuroblastoma patients into high- and low-risk groups, but predicting tumor progression and clinical management of high-risk patients remains a big challenge. Results: We integrate gene-level expression, array-based comparative genomic hybridization and functional gene-interaction network of 145 neuroblastoma patients to detect potential driver genes. The drivers are summarized into a driver-gene score (DGscore) for each patient, and we then validate its clinical relevance in terms of association with patient survival. Focusing on a subset of 48 clinically defined high-risk patients, we identify 193 recurrent regions of copy number alterations (CNAs), resulting in 274 altered genes whose copy-number gain or loss have parallel impact on the gene expression. Using a network enrichment analysis, we detect four common driver genes, ERCC6, HECTD2, KIAA1279, EMX2, and 66 patient-specific driver genes. Patients with high DGscore, thus carrying more copy-number-altered genes with correspondingly up- or down-regulated expression and functional implications, have worse survival than those with low DGscore (P = 0.006). Furthermore, Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis shows that, adjusted for age, tumor stage and MYCN amplification, DGscore is the only significant prognostic factor for high-risk neuroblastoma patients (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Integration of genomic copy number alteration, expression and functional interaction-network data reveals clinically relevant and prognostic putative driver genes in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. The identified putative drivers are potential drug targets for individualized therapy.

    "abstract": "Background: Various laboratory-developed metabolomic methods lead to big challenges in inter-laboratory comparability and effective integration of diverse datasets. Results: As part of the Quartet Project, we establish a publicly available suite of four metabolite reference materials derived from B lymphoblastoid cell lines from a family of parents and monozygotic twin daughters. We generate comprehensive LC–MS-based metabolomic data from the Quartet reference materials using targeted and untargeted strategies in different laboratories. The Quartet multi-sample-based signal-to-noise ratio enables objective assessment of the reliability of intra-batch and cross-batch metabolomics profiling in detecting intrinsic biological differences among the four groups of samples. Significant variations in the reliability of the metabolomics profiling are identified across laboratories. Importantly, ratio-based metabolomics profiling, by scaling the absolute values of a study sample relative to those of a common reference sample, enables cross-laboratory quantitative data integration. Thus, we construct the ratio-based high-confidence reference datasets between two reference samples, providing “ground truth” for inter-laboratory accuracy assessment, which enables objective evaluation of quantitative metabolomics profiling using various instruments and protocols. Conclusions: Our study provides the community with rich resources and best practices for inter-laboratory proficiency tests and data integration, ensuring reliability of large-scale and longitudinal metabolomic studies. © 2024, The Author(s).",

To promote the advance of precision oncology for breast cancer in China, here we report a large-scale prospective clinical sequencing program using the Fudan-BC panel, and comprehensively analyze the clinical and genomic characteristics of Chinese breast cancer. The mutational landscape of 1,134 breast cancers reveals that the most significant differences between Chinese and Western patients occurred in the hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer subtype. Mutations in p53 and Hippo signaling pathways are more prevalent, and 2 mutually exclusive and 9 co-occurring patterns exist among 9 oncogenic pathways in our cohort. Further preclinical investigation partially suggests that NF2 loss-of-function mutations can be sensitive to a Hippo-targeted strategy. We establish a public database (Fudan Portal) and a precision medicine knowledge base for data exchange and interpretation. Collectively, our study presents a leading approach to Chinese precision oncology treatment and reveals potentially actionable mutations in breast cancer. © 2020, The Author(s).",

Here, we provide a detailed atlas of 2,920 plasma proteins linking to diseases (406 prevalent and 660 incident) and 986 health-related traits in 53,026 individuals (median follow-up: 14.8 years) from the UK Biobank, representing the most comprehensive proteome profiles to date. This atlas revealed 168,100 protein-disease associations and 554,488 protein-trait associations. Over 650 proteins were shared among at least 50 diseases, and over 1,000 showed sex and age heterogeneity. Furthermore, proteins demonstrated promising potential in disease discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.80 in 183 diseases). Finally, integrating protein quantitative trait locus data determined 474 causal proteins, providing 37 drug-repurposing opportunities and 26 promising targets with favorable safety profiles.

    "abstract": "Background: Mutations in genes encoding sarcomere and cytoskeletal proteins are major causes of primary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Likewise, ischemic myocardial injury is a major cause of secondary cardiac remodeling, which, in a subset, is severe and resembles DCM. The latter is referred to as ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). We postulated the presence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (PVs and LPVs, respectively) in genes known to cause primary DCM might predispose the heart to severe cardiac dilatation and dysfunction post myocardial ischemic injury, i.e., IDCM. Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing in 1,041 patients with primary DCM, 215 patients with IDCM, and 414 healthy controls. Indices of cardiac size and function were similar between those with primary and ischemic DCM. PVs and LPVs, including the truncating variants in 36 genes known to cause primary DCM were identified and compared among the three groups. Results: Pathogenic variants and LPVs were detected in 266 individuals, comprised of 215/1,041 (20.7%) patients with DCM, 27/215 (12.6%) patients with IDCM, and 24/414 (5.8%) control individuals. PVs and LPVs in the TTN gene were the most common and detected in 130/1,041 (12.5%) of patients with DCM, 15/215 (7.0%) of cases with IDCM, and 10/414 (2.4%) control individuals. Of 135 TTNtv, 118 involved exons that were >90% spliced in. These variants were found in 120/1,041 (11.5%) of DCM patients, 6/215 (2.8%) of IDCM cases, and only in 1/414 (0.2%) of the control population (p < 0.001 among the three groups). Conclusions: Pathogenic variants and LPVs in genes known to cause primary DCM are enriched in patients with IDCM, suggesting that such variants function as susceptibility alleles for cardiac dilatation and dysfunction in post myocardial ischemic injury. Thus, IDCM shares a partial genetic etiology with the primary DCM. Copyright © 2021 Sun, Xiao, Li, Wang, Song, Li, Li, Chen, Li, Huang, Tan, Hu, Yu, Li, Wang, Jin, Shi, Marian and Wang.",

We report the first extensive genomic characterization of microbiomes, pathogens and antibiotic resistance cassettes in a tertiary-care hospital, from repeated sampling (up to 1.5 years apart) of 179 sites associated with 45 beds. Deep shotgun metagenomics unveiled distinct ecological niches of microbes and antibiotic resistance genes characterized by biofilm-forming and human-microbiome-influenced environments with corresponding patterns of spatiotemporal divergence. Quasi-metagenomics with nanopore sequencing provided thousands of high-contiguity genomes, phage and plasmid sequences (>60% novel), enabling characterization of resistome and mobilome diversity and dynamic architectures in hospital environments. Phylogenetics identified multidrug-resistant strains as being widely distributed and stably colonizing across sites. Comparisons with clinical isolates indicated that such microbes can persist in hospitals for extended periods (>8 years), to opportunistically infect patients.

More recently, NGS has been adopted in clinical oncology to advance personalized medicine. Clinical applications of precision oncology require accurate tests that can distinguish tumor-specific mutations from artifacts introduced during NGS processes or data analysis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop best practices in cancer mutation detection using NGS and the need for standard reference data sets for systematically measuring accuracy and reproducibility across platforms and methods. Within the SEQC2 consortium context, we established paired tumor-normal reference samples and generated whole-genome (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data using sixteen library protocols, seven sequencing platforms at six different centers. We systematically interrogated somatic mutations in the reference samples to identify factors affecting detection reproducibility and accuracy in cancer genomes. These large cross-platform/site WGS and WES datasets using well-characterized reference samples will represent a powerful resource for benchmarking NGS technologies, bioinformatics pipelines, and for the cancer genomics studies. © 2021, The Author(s).",

Many diseases and drug effects exhibit tissue specificity that may be reflected by tissue-specific gene-expression profiles. Here we construct a comprehensive mouse transcriptomic BodyMap across 17 tissues of six-weeks old C57BL/6JJcl mice using RNA-seq. We find different expression patterns between protein-coding and non-coding genes. Liver expressed the least complex transcriptomes, that is, the smallest number of genes detected in liver across all 17 tissues, whereas testis and ovary harbor more complex transcriptomes than other tissues. We report a comprehensive list of tissue-specific genes across 17 tissues, along with a list of 4,781 housekeeping genes in mouse. In addition, we propose a list of 27 consistently and highly expressed genes that can be used as reference controls in expression-profiling analysis. Our study provides a unique resource of mouse gene-expression profiles, which is helpful for further biomedical research. © 2017 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Molecular profiling guides precision treatment of breast cancer; however, Asian patients are underrepresented in publicly available large-scale studies. We established a comprehensive multiomics cohort of 773 Chinese patients with breast cancer and systematically analyzed their genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, radiomic and digital pathology characteristics. Here we show that compared to breast cancers in white individuals, Asian individuals had more targetable AKT1 mutations. Integrated analysis revealed a higher proportion of HER2-enriched subtype and correspondingly more frequent ERBB2 amplification and higher HER2 protein abundance in the Chinese HR+HER2+ cohort, stressing anti-HER2 therapy for these individuals. Furthermore, comprehensive metabolomic and proteomic analyses revealed ferroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for basal-like tumors. The integration of clinical, transcriptomic, metabolomic, radiomic and pathological features allowed for efficient stratification of patients into groups with varying recurrence risks. Our study provides a public resource and new insights into the biology and ancestry specificity of breast cancer in the Asian population, offering potential for further precision treatment approaches. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. 2024.",

However, many challenges still exist in how to efficiently process the RNA-seq data to obtain accurate and comprehensive results. Here we reviewed the strategies for improving diverse transcriptomic studies and the annotation of genetic variants based on RNA-seq data. Mapping RNA-seq reads to the genome and transcriptome represent two distinct methods for quantifying the expression of genes/transcripts. Besides the known genes annotated in current databases, many novel genes/transcripts (especially those long noncoding RNAs) still can be identified on the reference genome using RNA-seq. Moreover, owing to the incompleteness of current reference genomes, some novel genes are missing from them. Genome- guided and de novo transcriptome reconstruction are two effective and complementary strategies for identifying those novel genes/transcripts on or beyond the reference genome. In addition, integrating the genes of distinct databases to conduct transcriptomics and genetics studies can improve the results of corresponding analyses. © 2016, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Leflunomide, an anti-inflammatory drug used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has been marked with a black box warning regarding an increased risk of liver injury. The active metabolite of leflunomide, A771726, which also carries a boxed warning about potential hepatotoxicity, has been marketed as teriflunomide for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. Thus far, however, the mechanism of liver injury associated with the two drugs has remained elusive. In this study, cytotoxicity assays showed that ATP depletion and subsequent LDH release were induced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by leflunomide in HepG2 cells, and to a lesser extent, by A77 1726. The decline of cellular ATP levels caused by leflunomide was dramatically exacerbated when galactose was substituted for glucose as the sugar source, indicating a potential mitochondrial liability of leflunomide. By measuring the activities of immuno-captured mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, we found that leflunomide and A77 1726 preferentially targeted complex V (F1FO ATP synthase), with IC50 values of 35.0 and 63.7 μM, respectively. Bongkrekic acid, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore blocker that targets adenine nucleotide translocase, profoundly attenuated mitochondrial membrane depolarization, ATP depletion, and LDH leakage induced by leflunomide and A77 1726. Substantial alterations of mitochondrial function at the transcript level were observed in leflunomide-treated HepG2 cells, whereas the effects of A77 1726 on the cellular transcriptome were much less profound. Our results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may be implicated in the hepatotoxicity associated with leflunomide and A77 1726, with the former exhibiting higher toxicity potency. © 2018",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) remains challenging for various treatments. Ferroptosis, a recently identified form of cell death resulting from the unrestrained peroxidation of phospholipids, represents a potential vulnerability in TNBC. In this study, a high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-driven nanomotor is developed for effective therapy of TNBC through induction of ferroptosis. Through bioinformatics analysis of typical ferroptosis-associated genes in the FUSCCTNBC dataset, gambogic acid is identified as a promising ferroptosis drug and loaded it into the nanomotor. It is found that the rapid motion of nanomotors propelled by HIFU significantly enhanced tumor accumulation and penetration. More importantly, HIFU not only actuated nanomotors to trigger effective ferroptosis of TNBC cells, but also drove nanomotors to activate ferroptosis-mediated antitumor immunity in primary and metastatic TNBC models, resulting in effective tumor regression and prevention of metastases. Overall, HIFU-driven nanomotors show great potential for ferroptosis-immunotherapy of TNBC. © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.",

    "abstract": "The particularly interdisciplinary nature of human microbiome research makes the organization and reporting of results spanning epidemiology, biology, bioinformatics, translational medicine and statistics a challenge. Commonly used reporting guidelines for observational or genetic epidemiology studies lack key features specific to microbiome studies. Therefore, a multidisciplinary group of microbiome epidemiology researchers adapted guidelines for observational and genetic studies to culture-independent human microbiome studies, and also developed new reporting elements for laboratory, bioinformatics and statistical analyses tailored to microbiome studies. The resulting tool, called ‘Strengthening The Organization and Reporting of Microbiome Studies’ (STORMS), is composed of a 17-item checklist organized into six sections that correspond to the typical sections of a scientific publication, presented as an editable table for inclusion in supplementary materials. The STORMS checklist provides guidance for concise and complete reporting of microbiome studies that will facilitate manuscript preparation, peer review, and reader comprehension of publications and comparative analysis of published results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Infection by the Schistosoma japonicum can result in acute, chronic and late-stage manifestations. The latter often presents with severe organ failures and premature death. Importantly, infection can also produce autoimmune phenomena reflected by the development of autoantibodies. We wished to explore and profile the presence of autoantibodies in sera of patients with different stages of S. japonicum infection with the added aim of providing a reference assisting diagnosis. Blood samples from 55 patients with chronic and 20 patients with late-stage schistosomiasis japonica together, with a control group of 50 healthy people were randomly investigated against a microarray of 121 different autoantigens. In addition, the frequency of antibodies against Schistosoma egg antigen (SEA) was examined. In the sera from patients with chronic schistosomiasis japonica, 14 different highly expressed autoantibodies were detected, while patients with late-stage schistosomiasis were found to express as many as 43 autoantibody specificities together with a significantly higher frequency of antibodies against SEA compared to the control group. The findings presented suggest that autoantibody-based classification of schistosomiasis japonica represents a promising approach for the elucidation of subtypes of the disease. This approach may reflect differential disease mechanisms, which could ultimately lead to better treatment. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

    "abstract": "Unlike population-level approaches, single-cell RNA sequencing enables transcriptomic analysis of an individual cell. Through the combination of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools, single-cell RNA-seq can detect more than 10,000 transcripts in one cell to distinguish cell subsets and dynamic cellular changes. After several years’ development, single-cell RNA-seq can now achieve massively parallel, full-length mRNA sequencing as well as in situ sequencing and even has potential for multi-omic detection. One appealing area of single-cell RNA-seq is cancer research, and it is regarded as a promising way to enhance prognosis and provide more precise target therapy by identifying druggable subclones. Indeed, progresses have been made regarding solid tumor analysis to reveal intratumoral heterogeneity, correlations between signaling pathways, stemness, drug resistance, and tumor architecture shaping the microenvironment. Furthermore, through investigation into circulating tumor cells, many genes have been shown to promote a propensity toward stemness and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, to enhance anchoring and adhesion, and to be involved in mechanisms of anoikis resistance and drug resistance. This review focuses on advances and progresses of single-cell RNA-seq with regard to the following aspects: 1. Methodologies of single-cell RNA-seq 2. Single-cell isolation techniques 3. Single-cell RNA-seq in solid tumor research 4. Single-cell RNA-seq in circulating tumor cell research 5. Perspectives © 2017 Impact Journals LLC. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Translating RNA-seq into clinical diagnostics requires ensuring the reliability and cross-laboratory consistency of detecting clinically relevant subtle differential expressions, such as those between different disease subtypes or stages. As part of the Quartet project, we present an RNA-seq benchmarking study across 45 laboratories using the Quartet and MAQC reference samples spiked with ERCC controls. Based on multiple types of ‘ground truth’, we systematically assess the real-world RNA-seq performance and investigate the influencing factors involved in 26 experimental processes and 140 bioinformatics pipelines. Here we show greater inter-laboratory variations in detecting subtle differential expressions among the Quartet samples. Experimental factors including mRNA enrichment and strandedness, and each bioinformatics step, emerge as primary sources of variations in gene expression. We underscore the profound influence of experimental execution, and provide best practice recommendations for experimental designs, strategies for filtering low-expression genes, and the optimal gene annotation and analysis pipelines. In summary, this study lays the foundation for developing and quality control of RNA-seq for clinical diagnostic purposes. © The Author(s) 2024.",

    "abstract": "Background: Clinical laboratories routinely use formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue or cell block cytology samples in oncology panel sequencing to identify mutations that can predict patient response to targeted therapy. To understand the technical error due to FFPE processing, a robustly characterized diploid cell line was used to create FFPE samples with four different pre-tissue processing formalin fixation times. A total of 96 FFPE sections were then distributed to different laboratories for targeted sequencing analysis by four oncopanels, and variants resulting from technical error were identified. Results: Tissue sections that fail more frequently show low cellularity, lower than recommended library preparation DNA input, or target sequencing depth. Importantly, sections from block surfaces are more likely to show FFPE-specific errors, akin to “edge effects” seen in histology, while the inner samples display no quality degradation related to fixation time. Conclusions: To assure reliable results, we recommend avoiding the block surface portion and restricting mutation detection to genomic regions of high confidence. © 2022, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Background: Targeted sequencing using oncopanels requires comprehensive assessments of accuracy and detection sensitivity to ensure analytical validity. By employing reference materials characterized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-led SEquence Quality Control project phase2 (SEQC2) effort, we perform a cross-platform multi-lab evaluation of eight Pan-Cancer panels to assess best practices for oncopanel sequencing. Results: All panels demonstrate high sensitivity across targeted high-confidence coding regions and variant types for the variants previously verified to have variant allele frequency (VAF) in the 5–20% range. Sensitivity is reduced by utilizing VAF thresholds due to inherent variability in VAF measurements. Enforcing a VAF threshold for reporting has a positive impact on reducing false positive calls. Importantly, the false positive rate is found to be significantly higher outside the high-confidence coding regions, resulting in lower reproducibility. Thus, region restriction and VAF thresholds lead to low relative technical variability in estimating promising biomarkers and tumor mutational burden. Conclusion: This comprehensive study provides actionable guidelines for oncopanel sequencing and clear evidence that supports a simplified approach to assess the analytical performance of oncopanels. It will facilitate the rapid implementation, validation, and quality control of oncopanels in clinical use. © 2021, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "One important aspect of precision medicine aims to deliver the right medicine to the right patient at the right dose at the right time based on the unique 'omics' features of each individual patient, thus maximizing drug efficacy and minimizing adverse drug reactions. However, fragmentation and heterogeneity of available data makes it challenging to readily obtain first-hand information regarding some particular diseases, drugs, genes and variants of interest. Therefore, we developed the Precision Medicine Knowledgebase (PreMedKB) by seamlessly integrating the four fundamental components of precision medicine: diseases, genes, variants and drugs. PreMedKB allows for search of comprehensive information within each of the four components, the relationships between any two or more components, and importantly, the interpretation of the clinical meanings of a patient's genetic variants. Pre- MedKB is an efficient and user-friendly tool to assist researchers, clinicians or patients in interpreting a patient's genetic profile in terms of discovering potential pathogenic variants, recommending therapeutic regimens, designing panels for genetic testing kits, and matching patients for clinical trials.

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has shown that cardiomyocytes (CMs) can proliferate at a low level after myocardial infarction (MI), but it is insufficient to reestablish heart function. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proven to sufficiently induce rodent CM proliferation. However, whether miRNAs identified in rodents can promote human CM proliferation is unknown due to the poorly conserved functions of miRNAs among species. In the present study, we demonstrate that i) expression of microRNA-302d (miR-302d) decreased significantly during CM differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) from day 4 to day 18; ii) miR-302d efficiently promoted proliferation of hPSC-derived CMs; iii) miR-302d promoted CM proliferation by targeting LATS2 in the Hippo pathway; and iv) RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that overexpression of miR-302d induced changes in gene expression, which mainly converged on the cell cycle. Our study provides further evidence for the therapeutic potential of miR-302d. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society",

    "abstract": "Background: Genomic structural variations (SV) are important determinants of genotypic and phenotypic changes in many organisms. However, the detection of SV from next-generation sequencing data remains challenging. Results: In this study, DNA from a Chinese family quartet is sequenced at three different sequencing centers in triplicate. A total of 288 derivative data sets are generated utilizing different analysis pipelines and compared to identify sources of analytical variability. Mapping methods provide the major contribution to variability, followed by sequencing centers and replicates. Interestingly, SV supported by only one center or replicate often represent true positives with 47.02% and 45.44% overlapping the long-read SV call set, respectively. This is consistent with an overall higher false negative rate for SV calling in centers and replicates compared to mappers (15.72%). Finally, we observe that the SV calling variability also persists in a genotyping approach, indicating the impact of the underlying sequencing and preparation approaches. Conclusions: This study provides the first detailed insights into the sources of variability in SV identification from next-generation sequencing and highlights remaining challenges in SV calling for large cohorts. We further give recommendations on how to reduce SV calling variability and the choice of alignment methodology. © 2021, The Author(s).",

For better understanding of the risk factors associated with the onset and prognosis of this malignancy, we develop an interactive web-based tool for the convenient analysis of clinical and survival characteristics of EC patients. Methods: The clinical data were obtained from The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Seven analysis and visualization modules were built with Shiny. Results: The Esophageal Cancer Clinical Data Interactive Analysis (ECCDIA, http://webapps.3steps.cn/ECCDIA/) was developed to provide basic data analysis, visualization, survival analysis, and nomogram of the overall group and subgroups of 77,273 EC patients recorded in SEER. The basic data analysis modules contained distribution analysis of clinical factor ratios, Sankey plot analysis for relationships between clinical factors, and a map for visualizing the distribution of clinical factors. The survival analysis included Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and Cox analysis for different subgroups of EC patients. The nomogram module enabled clinicians to precisely predict the survival probability of different subgroups of EC patients. Conclusion: ECCDIA provides clinicians with an interactive prediction and visualization tool for visualizing invaluable clinical and prognostic information of individual EC patients, further providing useful information for better understanding of esophageal cancer. © 2020 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "To survive in the periodontal pocket, Porphyromonas gingivalis, the main causative agent of periodontal disease, must overcome oxidative and nitric oxide (NO) stress. Previously, we reported that, in the presence of NO comparable to stress conditions, the transcriptome of P.gingivalis was differentially expressed, and genes belonging to the PG1178-81 cluster were significantly upregulated. To further evaluate their role(s) in NO stress resistance, these genes were inactivated by allelic exchange mutagenesis. Isogenic mutants P.gingivalis FLL460 (ΔPG1181::ermF) and FLL461 (ΔPG1178-81::ermF) were black-pigmented, with gingipain and hemolytic activities comparable to that of the wild-type strain. Whereas the recovery of these isogenic mutants from NO stress was comparable to the wild-type, there was increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-induced stress. RNA-Seq analysis under conditions of NO stress showed that approximately 5 and 8% of the genome was modulated in P.gingivalis FLL460 and FLL461, respectively. The PG1178-81 gene cluster was shown to be part of the same transcriptional unit and is inducible in response to NO stress. In the presence of NO, PG1181, a putative transcriptional regulator, was shown to bind to its own promoter region and that of several other NO responsive genes including PG0214 an extracytoplasmic function σ factor, PG0893 and PG1236. Taken together, the data suggest that PG1181 is a NO responsive transcriptional regulator that may play an important role in the NO stress resistance regulatory network in P.gingivalis. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

    "abstract": "Pluripotency, differentiation, and X Chromosome inactivation (XCI) are key aspects of embryonic development. However, the underlying relationship and mechanisms among these processes remain unclear. Here, we systematically dissected these features along developmental progression using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and single-cell RNA sequencing with allelic resolution. We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, whereas EpiStem cells closely resembled the post-implantation epiblast. Sex-related gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental states. We also identified novel markers that were highly enriched in each developmental state. Moreover, we revealed that several novel pathways, including PluriNetWork and Focal Adhesion, were responsible for the delayed progression of female EpiStem cells. Importantly, we \"digitalized\" XCI progression using allelic expression of active and inactive X Chromosomes and surprisingly found that XCI states exhibited profound variability in each developmental state, including the 2i condition. XCI progression was not tightly synchronized with loss of pluripotency and increase of differentiation at the single-cell level, although these processes were globally correlated. In addition, highly expressed genes, including core pluripotency factors, were in general biallelically expressed. Taken together, our study sheds light on the dynamics of XCI progression and the asynchronicity between pluripotency, differentiation, and XCI. © 2016 Aldrup-MacDonald et al.",

Several methods have been established for the identification and quantification of miRNAs, including northern blotting, in situ hybridization (ISH), quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), bead arrays, microarray hybridization and next generation sequencing (NGS). miRNA expression profiling can be significantly influenced by both pre-analytical and analytical variables.

    "abstract": "Background: As the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are one of the most polymorphic genes in humans. Patients carrying certain HLA alleles may develop adverse drug reactions (ADRs) after taking specific drugs. Peptides play an important role in HLA related ADRs as they are the necessary co-binders of HLAs with drugs. Many experimental data have been generated for understanding HLA-peptide binding. However, efficiently utilizing the data for understanding and accurately predicting HLA-peptide binding is challenging. Therefore, we developed a network analysis based method to understand and predict HLA-peptide binding. Methods: Qualitative Class I HLA-peptide binding data were harvested and prepared from four major databases. An HLA-peptide binding network was constructed from this dataset and modules were identified by the fast greedy modularity optimization algorithm. To examine the significance of signals in the yielded models, the modularity was compared with the modularity values generated from 1,000 random networks. The peptides and HLAs in the modules were characterized by similarity analysis. The neighbor-edges based and unbiased leverage algorithm (Nebula) was developed for predicting HLA-peptide binding. Leave-one-out (LOO) validations and two-fold cross-validations were conducted to evaluate the performance of Nebula using the constructed HLA-peptide binding network. Results: Nine modules were identified from analyzing the HLA-peptide binding network with a highest modularity compared to all the random networks. Peptide length and functional side chains of amino acids at certain positions of the peptides were different among the modules. HLA sequences were module dependent to some extent. Nebula archived an overall prediction accuracy of 0.816 in the LOO validations and average accuracy of 0.795 in the two-fold cross-validations and outperformed the method reported in the literature. Conclusions: Network analysis is a useful approach for analyzing large and sparse datasets such as the HLA-peptide binding dataset. The modules identified from the network analysis clustered peptides and HLAs with similar sequences and properties of amino acids. Nebula performed well in the predictions of HLA-peptide binding. We demonstrated that network analysis coupled with Nebula is an efficient approach to understand and predict HLA-peptide binding interactions and thus, could further our understanding of ADRs. © 2015 Luo et al.",

Over the past years, rapid technological advances led by academic institutions and companies have continued to broaden NGS applications from research to the clinic. A recent crop of discoveries have highlighted the medical impact of NGS technologies on Mendelian and complex diseases, particularly cancer. However, the ever-increasing pace of NGS adoption presents enormous challenges in terms of data processing, storage, management and interpretation as well as sequencing quality control, which hinder the translation from sequence data into clinical practice. In this review, we first summarize the technical characteristics and performance of current NGS platforms. We further highlight advances in the applications of NGS technologies towards the development of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.

However, lacking of functional annotations for ncRNAs hampered us from carrying out the subsequent functional or predictive research. Here we dissected the expression profiles of 3,458 rat noncoding genes using rat bodymap RNA-sequencing data consisting of 11 solid organs over four developmental stages (juvenile, adolescent, adult and aged) from both sexes, and conducted a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed noncoding genes (DEnGs) between various conditions. We then constructed a co-expression network between protein-coding and noncoding genes to infer biological functions of noncoding genes. Modules of interest were linked to online databases including DAVID for functional annotation and pathway analysis. Our results indicated that noncoding genes are functionally enriched through pathways similar to those of protein-coding genes. Terms about development of the immune system were enriched with genes from age-related modules, whereas terms about sexual reproduction were enriched with genes in sex-related modules. We also built connection networks on some significant modules to visualize the interactions and regulatory relationship between protein-coding and noncoding genes. Our study could improve our understanding and facilitate a deeper investigation on organ/age/sex-related regulatory events of noncoding genes, which may lead to a superior preclinical model for drug development and translational medicine. © 2016 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool, but is costly and yields complex data sets that limit its utility in molecular diagnostic testing. A targeted quantitative RNA-sequencing method that is reproducible and reduces the number of sequencing reads required to measure transcripts over the full range of expression would be better suited to diagnostic testing. Toward this goal, we developed a competitive multiplex PCR-based amplicon sequencing library preparation method that a) targets only the sequences of interest and b) controls for inter-target variation in PCR amplification during library preparation by measuring each transcript native template relative to a known number of synthetic competitive template internal standard copies. To determine the utility of this method, we intentionally selected PCR conditions that would cause transcript amplification products (amplicons) to converge toward equimolar concentrations (normalization) during library preparation. We then tested whether this approach would enable accurate and reproducible quantification of each transcript across multiple library preparations, and at the same time reduce (through normalization) total sequencing reads required for quantification of transcript targets across a large range of expression. We demonstrate excellent reproducibility (R2 = 0.997) with 97% accuracy to detect 2-fold change using External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) reference materials; high inter-day, inter-site and inter-library concordance (R 2 = 0.97-0.99) using FDA Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) reference materials; and cross-platform concordance with both TaqMan qPCR (R2 = 0.96) and whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing following \"traditional\" library preparation using Illumina NGS kits (R2 = 0.94). Using this method, sequencing reads required to accurately quantify more than 100 targeted transcripts expressed over a 107-fold range was reduced more than 10,000-fold, from 2.3×109 to 1.4×105 sequencing reads. These studies demonstrate that the competitive multiplex-PCR amplicon library preparation method presented here provides the quality control, reproducibility, and reduced sequencing reads necessary for development and implementation of targeted quantitative RNA-sequencing biomarkers in molecular diagnostic testing.

In this study we examined the hypothesis that drugs that share the same therapeutic effect also share a common therapeutic mechanism by targeting not only known drug targets, but also by interacting unexpectedly on the same cryptic targets. By constructing and mining an Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug-oriented chemical-protein interactome (CPI) using a matrix of 10 drug molecules known to treat AD towards 401 human protein pockets, we found that such cryptic targets exist. We recovered from CPI the only validated therapeutic target of AD, acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), and highlighted several other putative targets. For example, we discovered that estrogen receptor (ER) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), which have recently been identified as two new therapeutic targets of AD, might already have been targeted by the marketed AD drugs. We further established that the CPI profile of a drug can reflect its interacting character towards multi-protein sets, and that drugs with the same therapeutic attribute will share a similar interacting profile. These findings indicate that the CPI could represent the landscape of chemical-protein interactions and uncover \"behind-the-scenes\" aspects of the therapeutic mechanisms of existing drugs, providing testable hypotheses of the key nodes for network pharmacology or brand new drug targets for one-target pharmacology paradigm. © 2010 Yang et al.",

By sequencing transcriptomes of low- and high-risk neuroblastomas, we detected differentially expressed annotated and nonannotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We identified a lncRNA neuroblastoma associated transcript-1 (. NBAT-1) as a biomarker significantly predicting clinical outcome of neuroblastoma. CpG methylation and a high-risk neuroblastoma associated SNP on chromosome 6p22 functionally contribute to NBAT-1 differential expression. Loss of NBAT-1 increases cellular proliferation and invasion. It controls these processes via epigenetic silencing of target genes. NBAT-1 loss affects neuronal differentiation through activation of the neuronal-specific transcription factor NRSF/. REST. Thus, loss of NBAT-1 contributes to aggressive neuroblastoma by increasing proliferation and impairing differentiation of neuronal precursors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

In our previous study, the microarray gene expression profiles of SWT on breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were found similar to the effect of β-estradiol (E2) on MCF-7 cells in the Connectivity Map database.Methods: Further data analysis was conducted to find the main similarities and differences between the effects of SWT and E2 on MCF-7 gene expression. The cell proliferation assay on MCF-7 (ER-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative) cells were used to examine such estrogenic activity. The estrogenic potency of SWT was further confirmed by estrogen-responsive element (ERE) luciferase reporter assay in MCF-7 cells.Results: Many estrogen regulated genes strongly up-regulated by E2 were similarly up-regulated by SWT, e.g., GREB1, PGR and EGR3. Of interest with regard to safety of SWT, the oncogenes MYBL1 and RET were strongly induced by E2 but not by SWT. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a highly concordant expression change in selected genes with data obtained by microarrays. Further supporting SWT's estrogenic activity, in MCF-7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells, SWT stimulated cell growth at lower concentrations (< 3.0 mg/ml), while at high concentrations, it inhibits the growth of both cell lines. The growth inhibitory potency of SWT was significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 than in MCF-7 cells. The SWT-induced cell growth of MCF-7 could be blocked by addition of the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. In addition, SWT was able to activate the ERE activity at lower concentrations. The herbal components Angelicae, Chuanxiong and Rehmanniae at lower concentrations (< 3.0 mg/ml) also showed growth-inducing and ERE-activating activity in MCF-7 cells.Conclusions: These results revealed a new mechanism to support the clinical use of SWT for estrogen related diseases and possibly for cancer prevention. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of using microarray transcriptional profiling to discover phytoestrogenic components that are present in natural products. © 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

Two recent large-scale HTS studies have reported results of such screens, revealing several known and novel drug sensitivities and biomarkers. Subsequent evaluation, however, found only moderate interlaboratory concordance in the drug response phenotypes, possibly due to differences in the experimental protocols used in the two studies. This highlights the need for community-wide implementation of standardized assays for measuring drug response phenotypes so that the full potential of HTS is realized. We suggest that the path forward is to establish best practices and standardization of the critical steps in these assays through a collective effort to ensure that the data produced from large-scale screens would not only be of high intrastudy consistency, so that they could be replicated and compared successfully across multiple laboratories. © 2014 American Association for Cancer Research.",

    "abstract": "Idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDRs) are rare, somewhat dose-independent, patient-specific and hard to predict. Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans, are highly polymorphic and are associated with specific IDRs. Therefore, it is important to identify potential drug-HLA associations so that individuals who would develop IDRs can be identified before drug exposure. We harvested the associations between drugs and class I HLAs from the literature. The results revealed that there are many drug-HLA pairs without clinical data. For better potential interactions of the drug-HLA pairs, molecular docking was used to explore the potential of associations between the drugs and HLAs. From the analysis of docking scores between the 17 drugs and 74 class I HLAs, it was observed that the known significantly associated drug-HLA pairs had statistically lower docking scores than those not reported to be significantly associated (t-test p < 0.05). This indicates that molecular docking could be utilized for screening drug-HLA interactions and predicting potential IDRs. Examining the binding modes of drugs in the docked HLAs suggested several distinct binding sites inside class I HLAs, expanding our knowledge of the underlying interaction mechanisms between drugs and HLAs. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Aristolochic Acid (AA), a natural component of Aristolochia plants that is found in a variety of herbal remedies and health supplements, is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Given that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in cancer initiation and progression and their role remains unknown in AA-induced carcinogenesis, we examined genome-wide AA-induced dysregulation of miRNAs as well as the regulation of miRNAs on their target gene expression in rat kidney. Results: We treated rats with 10 mg/kg AA and vehicle control for 12 weeks and eight kidney samples (4 for the treatment and 4 for the control) were used for examining miRNA and mRNA expression by deep sequencing, and protein expression by proteomics. AA treatment resulted in significant differential expression of miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins as measured by both principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). Specially, 63 miRNAs (adjusted p value < 0.05 and fold change > 1.5), 6,794 mRNAs (adjusted p value < 0.05 and fold change > 2.0), and 800 proteins (fold change > 2.0) were significantly altered by AA treatment. The expression of 6 selected miRNAs was validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) showed that cancer is the top network and disease associated with those dysregulated miRNAs. To further investigate the influence of miRNAs on kidney mRNA and protein expression, we combined proteomic and transcriptomic data in conjunction with miRNA target selection as confirmed and reported in miRTarBase. In addition to translational repression and transcriptional destabilization, we also found that miRNAs and their target genes were expressed in the same direction at levels of transcription (169) or translation (227). Furthermore, we identified that up-regulation of 13 oncogenic miRNAs was associated with translational activation of 45 out of 54 cancer-related targets. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that dysregulated miRNA expression plays an important role in AA-induced carcinogenesis in rat kidney, and that the integrated approach of multiple profiling provides a new insight into a post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs on their target repression and activation in a genome-wide scale. © 2015 Li et al.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system. Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive. Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumour type. In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The GDSC and CCLE investigators recently reported that their respective studies exhibit reasonable agreement and yield similar molecular predictors of drug response, seemingly contradicting our previous findings. Reanalyzing the authors' published methods and results, we found that their analysis failed to account for variability in the genomic data and more importantly compared different drug sensitivity measures from each study, which substantially deviate from our more stringent consistency assessment. Our comparison of the most updated genomic and pharmacological data from the GDSC and CCLE confirms our published findings that the measures of drug response reported by these two groups are not consistent. We believe that a principled approach to assess the reproducibility of drug sensitivity predictors is necessary before envisioning their translation into clinical settings. © 2016 Safikhani Z et al.",

    "abstract": "To pursue a systematic approach to discovery of mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), we used microarrays, bioinformatics and the \"Connectivity Map\" (CMAP) to examine TCM-induced changes in gene expression. We demonstrated that this approach can be used to elucidate new molecular targets using a model TCM herbal formula Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) which is widely used for women's health. The human breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with 0.1 μM estradiol or 2.56 mg/ml of SWT showed dramatic gene expression changes, while no significant change was detected for ferulic acid, a known bioactive compound of SWT. Pathway analysis using differentially expressed genes related to the treatment effect identified that expression of genes in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) cytoprotective pathway was most significantly affected by SWT, but not by estradiol or ferulic acid. The Nrf2-regulated genes HMOX1, GCLC, GCLM, SLC7A11 and NQO1 were upreguated by SWT in a dose-dependent manner, which was validated by real-time RT-PCR. Consistently, treatment with SWT and its four herbal ingredients resulted in an increased antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity in MCF-7 and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of differentially expressed genes related to SWT treatment was used to compare with those of 1,309 compounds in the CMAP database. The CMAP profiles of estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells showed an excellent match with SWT treatment, consistent with SWT's widely claimed use for women's diseases and indicating a phytoestrogenic effect. The CMAP profiles of chemopreventive agents withaferin A and resveratrol also showed high similarity to the profiles of SWT. This study identified SWT as an Nrf2 activator and phytoestrogen, suggesting its use as a nontoxic chemopreventive agent, and demonstrated the feasibility of combining microarray gene expression profiling with CMAP mining to discover mechanisms of actions and to identify new health benefits of TCMs.",

Here we use a comprehensive study design to generate Illumina RNA-seq and Affymetrix microarray data from the same liver samples of rats exposed in triplicate to varying degrees of perturbation by 27 chemicals representing multiple modes of action (MOAs). The cross-platform concordance in terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched pathways is linearly correlated with treatment effect size (R2 ≈ 0.8). Furthermore, the concordance is also affected by transcript abundance and biological complexity of the MOA. RNA-seq outperforms microarray (93% versus 75%) in DEG verification as assessed by quantitative PCR, with the gain mainly due to its improved accuracy for low-abundance transcripts. Nonetheless, classifiers to predict MOAs perform similarly when developed using data from either platform. Therefore, the endpoint studied and its biological complexity, transcript abundance and the genomic application are important factors in transcriptomic research and for clinical and regulatory decision making. © 2014 Contributions to Geophysics and Geodesy.",

This review summarizes community-wide efforts such as the MicroArray and Sequencing Quality Control (MAQC/SEQC) project which have identified factors influencing the performance of these technologies. Consequently, consensus-based standards and well-documented best practices have been developed to improve the quality of scientific research, and reference materials and reference datasets have been made available for evaluating the technical proficiency in future studies. These efforts have built the foundation on which the translational application of genomics based technologies can help realize precision medicine. © 2015 Future Medicine Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Many diseases and adverse drug reactions exhibit tissue specificity. To better understand the tissue-specific expression characteristics of transcripts in different human tissues, we deeply sequenced RNA samples from 14 different human tissues. After filtering many lowly expressed transcripts, 24,729 protein-coding transcripts and 1,653 noncoding transcripts were identified. By analyzing highly expressed tissue-specific protein-coding transcripts (TSCTs) and noncoding transcripts (TSNTs), we found that testis expressed the highest numbers of TSCTs and TSNTs. Brain, monocytes, ovary, and heart expressed more TSCTs than the rest tissues, whereas brain, placenta, heart, and monocytes expressed more TSNTs than other tissues. Co-expression network constructed based on the TSCTs and TSNTs showed that each hub TSNT was co-expressed with several TSCTs, allowing functional annotation of TSNTs. Important biological processes and KEGG pathways highly related to the specific functions or diseases of each tissue were enriched with the corresponding TSCTs. These TSCTs and TSNTs may participate in the tissue-specific physiological or pathological processes. Our study provided a unique data set and systematic analysis of expression characteristics and functions of both TSCTs and TSNTs based on 14 distinct human tissues, and could facilitate future investigation of the mechanisms behind tissue-specific diseases and adverse drug reactions.",

    "abstract": "The rat has been used extensively as a model for evaluating chemical toxicities and for understanding drug mechanisms. However, its transcriptome across multiple organs, or developmental stages, has not yet been reported. Here we show, as part of the SEQC consortium efforts, a comprehensive rat transcriptomic BodyMap created by performing RNA-Seq on 320 samples from 11 organs of both sexes of juvenile, adolescent, adult and aged Fischer 344 rats. We catalogue the expression profiles of 40,064 genes, 65,167 transcripts, 31,909 alternatively spliced transcript variants and 2,367 non-coding genes/non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) annotated in AceView. We find that organ-enriched, differentially expressed genes reflect the known organ-specific biological activities. A large number of transcripts show organ-specific, age-dependent or sex-specific differential expression patterns. We create a web-based, open-access rat BodyMap database of expression profiles with crosslinks to other widely used databases, anticipating that it will serve as a primary resource for biomedical research using the rat model.

    "abstract": "We present primary results from the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project, coordinated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Examining Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD and Roche 454 platforms at multiple laboratory sites using reference RNA samples with built-in controls, we assess RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) performance for junction discovery and differential expression profiling and compare it to microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data using complementary metrics. At all sequencing depths, we discover unannotated exon-exon junctions, with >80% validated by qPCR. We find that measurements of relative expression are accurate and reproducible across sites and platforms if specific filters are used. In contrast, RNA-seq and microarrays do not provide accurate absolute measurements, and gene-specific biases are observed for all examined platforms, including qPCR. Measurement performance depends on the platform and data analysis pipeline, and variation is large for transcript-level profiling. The complete SEQC data sets, comprising >100 billion reads (10Tb), provide unique resources for evaluating RNA-seq analyses for clinical and regulatory settings. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

    "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may cause serious side-effects that draw great attention from both academia and industry. Since some DDIs are mediated by unexpected drug-human protein interactions, it is reasonable to analyze the chemical-protein interactome (CPI) profiles of the drugs to predict their DDIs. Here we introduce the DDI-CPI server, which can make real-time DDI predictions based only on molecular structure. When the user submits a molecule, the server will dock user's molecule across 611 human proteins, generating a CPI profile that can be used as a feature vector for the pre-constructed prediction model. It can suggest potential DDIs between the user's molecule and our library of 2515 drug molecules. In cross-validation and independent validation, the server achieved an AUC greater than 0.85. Additionally, by investigating the CPI profiles of predicted DDI, users can explore the PK/PD proteins that might be involved in a particular DDI.

In order to fully understand the power and limitations of this technology, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched the third phase of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC-III) project, also known as the SEquencing Quality Control (SEQC) project. Using two well-established human reference RNA samples from the first phase of the MAQC project, three sequencing platforms were tested across more than ten sites with built-in truths including spike-in of external RNA controls (ERCC), titration data and qPCR verification. The SEQC project generated over 30 billion sequence reads representing the largest RNA-Seq data ever generated by a single project on individual RNA samples. This extraordinarily ultradeep transcriptomic data set and the known truths built into the study design provide many opportunities for further research and development to advance the improvement and application of RNA-Seq.",

Materials & methods: Electronic databases were searched to extensively identify drug-HLA association studies from 1966 to present. Results: A drug-HLA-IDR database, HLADR, was created. The drug-HLA relationship network clearly reflected an ethnicity dependency of the associations. The positive predictive values and the negative predictive values demonstrated that other potential factors may also regulate the occurrence of HLA-specific IDRs. Conclusions: Constructing studies with samples from homogeneous ethnic groups and identifying cofactors that affect negative predictive values and positive predictive values will become necessary to enhance the predictability of HLA biomarkers for future research on IDRs. © 2015 Future Medicine Ltd.",

The method involves firstly obtaining possible in vivo active components, i.e., the \"absorbable\" components from the permeate of the Caco-2 monolayer model to simulate oral administration of two specific SWT products (CU-SWT, J-SWT), their component single herbs (Angelicae, Chuanxiong, Paeoniae, and Rehmanniae), and a standard mixture of active compounds (ferulic acid, ligustilide, senkyunolide A). Then, these respective absorbable components were incubated with MCF-7 cells to determine the gene expression profile using microarray processing/analysis as well as real-time PCR. From the available DEGs identified following the incubation, the magnitude of change in DEGs by real-time PCR was found to be consistent with that by microarray. The designated DEGs from the CU-SWT permeate were found to be distinct from other 19 products. Furthermore, the changes in the DEGs resulting from MCF-7 cells treated by eight replicate extracts of CU-SWT on three separate days were consistent. These results demonstrated sufficient specificity and consistency of the DEG panel which could serve as a unique bioactive \"fingerprint\" for the designated SWT product. The present method for DEG determination may be applied to other TCM products and with further definitive study can potentially provide a unique method for quality control of TCM in the future. © 2013 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.",

Here we systematically explored the characteristics and functions of such human bifunctional RNAs by integrating tandem mass spectrometry and RNA-seq data. We first constructed a pipeline to identify and annotate bifunctional RNAs, leading to the characterization of 132 high-confidence bifunctional RNAs. Our analyses indicate that bifunctional RNAs may be involved in human embryonic development and can be functional in diverse tissues. Moreover, bifunctional RNAs could interact with multiple miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins to exert their corresponding roles. Bifunctional RNAs may also function as competing endogenous RNAs to regulate the expression of many genes by competing for common targeting miRNAs. Finally, somatic mutations of diverse carcinomas may generate harmful effect on corresponding bifunctional RNAs. Collectively, our study not only provides the pipeline for identifying and annotating bifunctional RNAs but also reveals their important gene-regulatory functions. © 2016, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "A leading cause of cancer chemotherapy failure is chemoresistance, which often involves multiple mechanisms. Chinese medicines (CM) usually contain multiple components which could potentially target many mechanisms simultaneously and may offer an advantage over single compounds that target one mechanism at a time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the chemosensitizing effect (CE) of a specific CM, tripterygium wilfordii (TW), on prostate cancer cells resistant to docetaxel (Dtx) and identify the potential mechanisms. The CE of TW (in combination with Dtx) was evaluated in two Dtx resistant prostate cancer cell lines (PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR) and the efficacy of the combination for resistant PC3-TxR tumor was investigated using a xenograft mouse model. For mechanistic study, the inhibitory effect of TW on P-glycoprotein activity was assessed. In addition, novel gene targets of TW were identified using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR. Results showed that TW induced a CE of 8 and > 38 folds in PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells, respectively with Dtx IC50 reversed back to that of the sensitive parent cells. An optimum dose of TW+Dtx significantly retarded tumor growth in mice compared to TW or Dtx alone. TW inhibited P-glycoprotein activity and induced a significant gene expression changes in genes related to angiogenesis, cell cycle regulation and differentiation. Our in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that TW in combination with Dtx was able to overcome the chemoresistance and suppress resistant prostate tumor growth via multi-mechanisms.",

These control ratio mixtures with defined abundance ratios enable assessment of diagnostic performance of differentially expressed transcript lists, limit of detection of ratio (LODR) estimates and expression ratio variability and measurement bias. The performance metrics suite is applicable to analysis of a typical experiment, and here we also apply these metrics to evaluate technical performance among laboratories. An interlaboratory study using identical samples shared among 12 laboratories with three different measurement processes demonstrates generally consistent diagnostic power across 11 laboratories. Ratio measurement variability and bias are also comparable among laboratories for the same measurement process.

The chemicals represented multiple chemogenomic modes of action (MOA) and exhibited varying degrees of transcriptional response. The paired-end 100 bp sequencing data were generated using Illumina HiScanSQ and/or HiSeq 2000. In addition to the core study, six animals (i.e., three aflatoxin B1 treated rats and three vehicle control rats) were sequenced three times, with two separate library preparations on two sequencing machines.

    "abstract": "Background: Gene expression profiling is being widely applied in cancer research to identify biomarkers for clinical endpoint prediction. Since RNA-seq provides a powerful tool for transcriptome-based applications beyond the limitations of microarrays, we sought to systematically evaluate the performance of RNA-seq-based and microarray-based classifiers in this MAQC-III/SEQC study for clinical endpoint prediction using neuroblastoma as a model. Results: We generate gene expression profiles from 498 primary neuroblastomas using both RNA-seq and 44 k microarrays. Characterization of the neuroblastoma transcriptome by RNA-seq reveals that more than 48,000 genes and 200,000 transcripts are being expressed in this malignancy. We also find that RNA-seq provides much more detailed information on specific transcript expression patterns in clinico-genetic neuroblastoma subgroups than microarrays. To systematically compare the power of RNA-seq and microarray-based models in predicting clinical endpoints, we divide the cohort randomly into training and validation sets and develop 360 predictive models on six clinical endpoints of varying predictability. Evaluation of factors potentially affecting model performances reveals that prediction accuracies are most strongly influenced by the nature of the clinical endpoint, whereas technological platforms (RNA-seq vs. microarrays), RNA-seq data analysis pipelines, and feature levels (gene vs. transcript vs. exon-junction level) do not significantly affect performances of the models. Conclusions: We demonstrate that RNA-seq outperforms microarrays in determining the transcriptomic characteristics of cancer, while RNA-seq and microarray-based models perform similarly in clinical endpoint prediction. Our findings may be valuable to guide future studies on the development of gene expression-based predictive models and their implementation in clinical practice. © 2015 Zhang et al.",

    "abstract": "In the era of personalized medical practice, understanding the genetic basis of patient-specific adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a major challenge. Clozapine provides effective treatments for schizophrenia but its usage is limited because of life-threatening agranulocytosis. A recent high impact study showed the necessity of moving clozapine to a first line drug, thus identifying the biomarkers for drug-induced agranulocytosis has become important. Here we report a methodology termed as antithesis chemical-protein interactome (CPI), which utilizes the docking method to mimic the differences in the drug-protein interactions across a panel of human proteins. Using this method, we identified HSPA1A, a known susceptibility gene for CIA, to be the off-target of clozapine. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of HSPA1A-related genes (off-target associated systems) was also found to be differentially expressed in clozapine treated leukemia cell line. Apart from identifying the CIA causal genes we identified several novel candidate genes which could be responsible for agranulocytosis. Proteins related to reactive oxygen clearance system, such as oxidoreductases and glutathione metabolite enzymes, were significantly enriched in the antithesis CPI. This methodology conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of drugs' perturbation to the biological system, investigating both the off-targets and the associated off-systems to explore the molecular basis of an adverse event or the new uses for old drugs. © 2011 Yang et al.",

    "abstract": "The cost of developing a new drug has increased sharply over the past years. To ensure a reasonable return-on-investment, it is useful for drug discovery researchers in both industry and academia to identify all the possible indications for early pipeline molecules. For the first time, we propose the term computational \"drug candidate positioning\" or \"drug positioning\", to describe the above process. It is distinct from drug repositioning, which identifies new uses for existing drugs and maximizes their value. Since many therapeutic effects are mediated by unexpected drug-protein interactions, it is reasonable to analyze the chemical-protein interactome (CPI) profiles to predict indications. Here we introduce the server DPDR-CPI, which can make real-time predictions based only on the structure of the small molecule. When a user submits a molecule, the server will dock it across 611 human proteins, generating a CPI profile of features that can be used for predictions. It can suggest the likelihood of relevance of the input molecule towards ∼1,000 human diseases with top predictions listed. DPDR-CPI achieved an overall AUROC of 0.78 during 10-fold cross-validations and AUROC of 0.76 for the independent validation.

    "abstract": "Identifying new indications for existing drugs (drug repositioning) is an efficient way of maximizing their potential. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is one of the leading causes of death among hospitalized patients. As both new indications and ADRs are caused by unexpected chemical-protein interactions on off-targets, it is reasonable to predict these interactions by mining the chemical-protein interactome (CPI). Making such predictions has recently been facilitated by a web server named DRAR-CPI. This server has a representative collection of drug molecules and targetable human proteins built up from our work in drug repositioning and ADR. When a user submits a molecule, the server will give the positive or negative association scores between the user's molecule and our library drugs based on their interaction profiles towards the targets. Users can thus predict the indications or ADRs of their molecule based on the association scores towards our library drugs. We have matched our predictions of drug-drug associations with those predicted via gene-expression profiles, achieving a matching rate as high as 74. We have also successfully predicted the connections between anti-psychotics and anti-infectives, indicating the underlying relevance of anti-psychotics in the potential treatment of infections, vice versa.

Analysis of variations in guanine-cytosine content, gene coverage, sequencing error rate and insert size allowed identification of decreased reproducibility across sites. Moreover, commonly used methods for normalization (cqn, EDASeq, RUV2, sva, PEER) varied in their ability to remove these systematic biases, depending on sample complexity and initial data quality.

Thus, RNA controls with known concentrations and sequence identities originally developed by the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) for microarray and qPCR platforms have recently been proposed for RNA-Seq platforms, but only with a limited number of samples. In this study, we report our analysis of RNA-Seq data from 92 ERCC controls spiked in a diverse collection of 447 RNA samples from eight ongoing studies involving five species (human, rat, mouse, chicken, and Schistosoma japonicum) and two mRNA enrichment protocols, i. e., poly(A) and RiboZero. The entire collection of datasets consisted of 15650143175 short sequence reads, 131603796 (i. e., 0. 84%) of which were mapped to the 92 ERCC references. The overall ERCC mapping ratio of 0. 84% is close to the expected value of 1. 0% when assuming a 2. 0% mRNA fraction in total RNA, but showed a difference of 2. 8-fold across studies and 4. 3-fold among samples from the same study with one tissue type. This level of fluctuation may prevent the ERCC controls from being used for cross-sample normalization in RNA-Seq. Furthermore, we observed striking biases of quantification between poly(A) and RiboZero which are transcript-specific. For example, ERCC-00116 showed a 7. 3-fold under-enrichment in poly(A) compared to RiboZero. Extra care is needed in integrative analysis of multiple datasets and technical artifacts of protocol differences should not be taken as true biological findings. © 2013 The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major cause of drug failures in both the preclinical and clinical phase. Consequently, improving prediction of DILI at an early stage of drug discovery will reduce the potential failures in the subsequent drug development program. In this regard, high-content screening (HCS) assays are considered as a promising strategy for the study of DILI; however, the predictive performance of HCS assays is frequently insufficient. In the present study, a new testing strategy was developed to improve DILI prediction by employing in vitro assays that was combined with the RO2 model (i.e., 'rule-of-two' defined by daily dose ≥100 mg/day & logP ≥3). The RO2 model was derived from the observation that high daily doses and lipophilicity of an oral medication were associated with significant DILI risk in humans. In the developed testing strategy, the RO2 model was used for the rational selection of candidates for HCS assays, and only the negatives predicted by the RO2 model were further investigated by HCS. Subsequently, the effects of drug treatment on cell loss, nuclear size, DNA damage/fragmentation, apoptosis, lysosomal mass, mitochondrial membrane potential, and steatosis were studied in cultures of primary rat hepatocytes. Using a set of 70 drugs with clear evidence of clinically relevant DILI, the testing strategy improved the accuracies by 10 % and reduced the number of drugs requiring experimental assessment by approximately 20 %, as compared to the HCS assay alone. Moreover, the testing strategy was further validated by including published data (Cosgrove et al. in Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 237:317-330, 2009) on drug-cytokine-induced hepatotoxicity, which improved the accuracies by 7 %. Taken collectively, the proposed testing strategy can significantly improve the prediction of in vitro assays for detecting DILI liability in an early drug discovery phase. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this review is to comprehensively summarize the recent achievements in the field of toxicogenomics and cancer research regarding genetic-environmental interactions in carcinogenesis and detection of genetic aberrations in cancer genomes by next-generation sequencing technology. Cancer is primarily a genetic disease in which genetic factors and environmental stimuli interact to cause genetic and epigenetic aberrations in human cells. Mutations in the germline act as either high-penetrance alleles that strongly increase the risk of cancer development, or as low-penetrance alleles that mildly change an individual's susceptibility to cancer. Somatic mutations, resulting from either DNA damage induced by exposure to environmental mutagens or from spontaneous errors in DNA replication or repair are involved in the development or progression of the cancer. Induced or spontaneous changes in the epigenome may also drive carcinogenesis. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology provide us opportunities to accurately, economically, and rapidly identify genetic variants, somatic mutations, gene expression profiles, and epigenetic alterations with single-base resolution. Whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and RNA sequencing of paired cancer and adjacent normal tissue present a comprehensive picture of the cancer genome. These new findings should benefit public health by providing insights in understanding cancer biology, and in improving cancer diagnosis and therapy. © 2014 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

    "abstract": "For almost 30 years, we have known that dynamic changes in the expression of individual gene transcripts are involved in adaptive neuroendocrine responses. Now, our detailed knowledge of mammalian genomes has been applied experimentally using new RNA technologies to show that physiological changes in gene expression are, in fact, manifold, demanding a more global consideration of ‘transcriptome dynamics.' This term is appropriate because our studies have shown that a major proportion of cellular transcripts (multiple thousands of genes) are dynamically regulated as part of daily changes in the functional activity of a neuroendocrine gland, the pineal. The regulated pool of transcripts includes both protein-coding and non-coding RNAs. To begin to understand transcriptome dynamics in the context of neuroendocrine system physiology, we first need to know the genomic-level mechanisms that coordinate these changes, and secondly, the functional relationships between individual genes and groups of genes. We have obtained insights into pineal gland transcriptome dynamics by combining multiple approaches: in vivo and in vitro experimental paradigms, bioinformatics and also comparative analysis of transcriptomes across different species including rodents (rat and mouse), birds (chicken), and fish (zebrafish). In these non-mammalian species, an endogenous clock controls rhythmic expression, whereas in the rat we have identified a dominant norepinephrine-cAMP pathway that drives rhythmic pineal gene expression. Analysis of individual gene dynamics in the rat has revealed diverse gene-specific temporal expression patterns that highlight gene-specific components of the dynamic, tailored to discrete functional actions. Our focused analysis of specific genes has begun to characterize these subcomponents of the overall transcriptome dynamic with subgroups of genes being organized into restricted regulatory hierarchies. Future analysis of transcriptome data sets will involve the development of new bioinformatic approaches coupled with more sophisticated gene targeting. Addressing fundamental knowledge gaps in this research area will provide us with a deeper understanding of neuroendocrine control mechanisms that will be more apposite for advancing health and wellbeing. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
