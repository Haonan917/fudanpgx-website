    "intro": "Dr. Leming Shi is a professor at the School of Life Sciences and Shanghai Cancer Center of Fudan \nUniversity. Dr. Shi's research aims to improve the success rate of drug discovery and development \nand to promote precision medicine by generating, analyzing and integrating high-quality multi-omics\ndata. Dr. Shi conceived and led the MicroArray and Sequencing Quality Control (MAQC/SEQC) \nconsortia. These efforts led to the development of multiple FDA guidance documents and the \nlaunch of the International MAQC Society (www.maqcsociety.org) to enhance the reproducibility of \nhigh-throughput technologies. Dr. Shi was a co-founder of Chipscreen Biosciences where he \nco-developed a chemogenomics-based drug discovery platform, leading to the marketing approvals\nof one novel HDAC inhibitor (Chidamide) for treating cancers and one novel PPARα/γ/δ pan-agonist\n(Chiglitazar) for treating type 2 diabetes. Dr. Shi and his collaborators developed a multi-omics-based\napproach for molecular subtyping and precision treatment of breast cancers (Cancer \nCell 2019, Nature Genetics 2023, Nature Cancer 2024). Dr. Shi's team recently developed the first \nsuite of certified multi-omics reference materials (chinese-quartet.org), facilitating the development\nof a ratio-based multi-omics quantification approach that is inherently more resistant to \nbatch effects (Nature Biotechnology 2024a,b). Dr. Shi has published over 200 papers and (co-)led \nthe development of four ISO and CLSI standards and guidance on genomics.",
